48	"Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.

76	"How to convert all your black money into white in 4 easy perfectly ""legal"" steps?
Answer:-
-> Step 1 - Create a political party, and get registered under Representation of People's Act, 1951. [Not a difficult task. There are more than 1000 registered parties who didn't even contest 2014 Lok Sabha Election, and EC cannot de-register a party]
-> Step 2 - Donate all your black money to your party in parts, each part should be less than 20,000. You can make infinite such donations, and say that they came from people.
[According to the RP Act 1951, the political parties are not required to report (to the Election Commission of India (ECI)) the name of the individuals or organizations from whom they have received donations of amount less than Rs.20,000.]
-> Step 3 - Go to bank, deposit all this amount in the party's account.
[No need to pay any income tax. Political parties are 100% exempted from income tax]
-> Step 4 - Withdraw the amount as and when you need, in 50/100/500/2000 rupee notes - It is all white.
[Since Political Parties are not under RTI, you can't ask them how they spent their money]
ENJOY YOUR WEALTH...!!!!
*Moral of the Story:- All political parties are same. All they do is follow the letter of law like above example & kill the spirit which is politically correct but ethically incorrect. But in the process teach you about how one can legally generate enormous wealth and still talk about ideals and concern for poor people.

135	"The Sikhs are a very peace loving community & don’t seek criminal retribution against anyone. Our Gurus have taught us to help other people in need irrespective of their caste or creed. During the days of the Mughals, the Sikhs used to protect the Hindu families & their women from the Muslims. All that they want from the Govt is that a proper & unbiased legal action be taken against the accused in order to infuse some sense of hope into the victims’ families of which they have been deprived for so many years. The Govt also has to provide adequate money & resettlement options for many of the victims’ families who lost their breadwinners in the Genocide & are still living in urban ghettos.

THIS INCIDENT HAS REALLY SHAKEN THE FAITH OF THE SIKH MINORITY COMMUNITY IN THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT & MANY OF THE AFFECTED FAMILIES HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY. I distinctly remember those fateful days as I was studying in school in Delhi at that time. For the first time in my life, I felt like being a member of a Minority community in India. Even now, in Delhi & adjoining areas of the Hindi speaking Cow belt, Sikhs are subjected to racist taunts, humiliated & made fun of them due to their unique identity. Even I was subjected to these humiliating taunts during my school days in Delhi.

Her only qualification was that she was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru was responsible for the Partition of India. You can read the book written by Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad in case you have any doubts.

It is very sad that even 27 years after the massacre of innocent Sikhs that took place between Nov 1-3 1984 following Indira's death no justice has been delivered either to the victims of this heinous GENOCIDE nor any of its perpetrators (mostly local Congress MLAs & their Goons) have been tried or brought to book. According to the BBC, early 20,000 SIKHS were massacred in broad daylight all over India within 4 days & the State Police (like the Delhi Police) did nothing to stop this brutal ETHNIC CLEANSING. They merely stood there like mute spectators watching the grisly spectacle being enacted & at some instances, even colluding with the perpetrators. It is not possible to commit such a large scale murder within such a short span of time without the connivance of local Congress MLAs (or maybe even Senior Congress leaders) who, like in DELHI & elsewhere, incited the mobs with Vitriolic speeches to kill every Sikh & gave their Goons the voters' lists to aid them in tracking down Sikh Homes, freely offered money, distributed arms & offered financial rewards to their Goons to kill the Sikhs as most of these Murderers were illiterate. THEIR SENIOR MINISTERS LIKE JAGDISH TYTLER & KAMAL NATH ARE INVOLVED IN THIS GENOCIDE. During this time, Sikhs were burnt alive in front of their families, killed with Iron rods, & their women were taken & raped & their places of worship desecrated. For the Sikh Community it was like another HOLOCAUST. More casualties happened in CONGRESS ruled states (obviously).The State Police became deaf to the repeated pleas by the affected Sikh families for protection as the irate mobs continued their grisly act in on one Sikh locality after another. In many Sikh localities, entire Sikh communities were wiped out. There are photos of people laughing as they were beating the Sikhs to death. 

I was 13 years old in Delhi when this carnage took place. I have very vivid & painful memories of those days. I am also a Sikh, but luckily we were safe as our residence was in the Delhi Cantonment which was a secure area. Had I been in an insecure area, I would have met the same fate. My Father picked up me & my Sister from our School bus on Oct 31, 1984 as we had to walk a slight distance to our house. I remember the entire city being under curfew, between Nov 1-4, 1984 & I did not go to school for a month. An eerie silence of Death was pervading over the entire city. For the first time I felt being someone from the Minority community who is living in a country being ruled by the Majority community. I remember seeing black fumes coming from nearby Janakpuri on Nov 1. We had to install Security guards outside our house for a month before things calmed down though we too got threatening phone calls that a mob is coming to our house too to kill us. 

The Government has only adopted delaying tactics till now (even 27 years after the carnage) by forming committees after committees to probe into this MASS GENOCIDE, despite repeated testimonies from the Victims' families in Court whose near & dear ones where killed in these riots, but sadly, JUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN DELIVERED EVEN TILL NOW & the perpetrators & their goons are still roaming scot free. It is obvious the Government is trying to shield them & some Big names are also involved.

I feel the Sikh Community should file a case in the International Criminal Court at The Hague as the Indian Govt has failed to deliver justice to the affected families & till the present Govt is there, no justice will be delivered. JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED. Till the Indian Govt delivers prompt & effective justice to the victims of 1984 Anti Sikh Pogroms, I won't be surprised if this carnage is again repeated & it will remain as a DARK CHAPTER IN INDIA'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD."	1
136	The only problem govt facing from the opposition now, is queues in bank and 100 rs. shortage in atms. this can be easily solved. order all banks, on warfoot measure to install POS machines in all milk booths, govt provisional stores, petrol bunks buses and trains and all other retail outlets. popularise with tv advts of pay tms and sbi buddy and all other fund transfer modes. remember millions and millions of debit cards remain idle with the public, and they are not only for withdrawing cash from atm. if these are applied simaltaneously, the situation will ease very quickly. Take steps today itself and very important thing is make the public aware these steps are being taken at a rapid pace and things will become normal very soon. At least if these measures are successful in metros and urbans, there will be plenty of availablity of cash notes which can be sent to rural areas. all depends how fast you act making the public aware govt is solving the problem	1

229	"Why India Should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
Indus Water Treaty Is Illegal
The case of the 1960 Indus waters treaty, it has been signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and “nowhere it is declared that the said agreement/treaty has been signed in the name of the President of India”, 
“According to the ministry of external affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India...,” 

“According to the impugned agreement 80% water goes to Pakistan which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India coupled with further financial and natural injuries to national interest.”

If We Indians Keep Quit Today Our Future Generations Will Blame Us And Never Going To Forgive Us

India Need Be Like China Fast And Furious And Must Have Ability To Say On Face.
China Claim South China Sea 
China Made And Develop 7 Artificial Man Made Islands On The South China Sea So Quickly 
Then Why Can't India Stop Water From Our Own States And Union Territories Of India
We Need To Build More Dam On Indus River And Must Have Iccha-Shakti To Say Only One Sentence To World Bank F*ck Off 
India Is Scraping Indus Waters Treaty

If China Can Do For Their Mother Land 
Then Why Not India (If India Cannot Do)
Then Their Is Some Serious Problem In Our Indian Government System With Our Political Partys And Also With Our Useless Politician.
Who Just Know To Bark But Cannot Take Action.

254	"India is a Hindu country, secularism is a slow but sure way to convert it into Islamic. As soon as muslims are in majority, all this talk of secularism will be meaningless.

You will find a vast majority of Indian muslims sympathetic to the Saudi regime style shariat laws, banning of other religions in most Islamic countries and justifying the Islamic practices. Many are openly speaking of support for Fatwas against those who speak their minds....they attack those who say the truth. Examples of Tarek Fateh and Taslima Nasreen are there for all to see.

Secularism is only a tool to deceive Hindus. 

Secularism is not a one way street, are muslims secular? If not, india should never make the mistake of being secular."	1

361	Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.	1

509	"(Representative image) Thiruvananthapuram: According to an intelligence report submitted to the state police chief seven months ago, and accessed by TOI, two 'recognised' religious conversion centres in Kozhikode and Malappuram converted as many as 5,793 people to Islam between 2011 and 2015. Conversions happening in unrecognised centres in the state could be much higher, fear top government officials who, for obvious reasons, didn't want to be named. The report states that almost half of those who converted to Islam are women, and that the majority of these women (76%) are below 35 years. Of those converted, 4,719 were Hindus and the remaining 1,074 mostly Christian. The conversions happened at Tharbiyathul Islam Sabha in Kozhikode and Monunsthil Islam Sabha at Ponnani, two traditional religious institutions in the state 'authorized' to convert people from other religions to Islam. The police report, prepared in connection with the conversion of Nimisha alias Fathima -currently missing along with 20 others from the state and suspected to have joined Islamic State -says that a detailed inquiry is required to verify whether these conversions were under duress, whether there were enticements involved or were voluntary . ""Inquiries are required to know whether this will affect the communal harmony , internal security of the state and nation. A detailed SSB (state special branch) inquiry in Kasaragod, Kannur, Alappuzha, Thiruvananthapuram and Palakkad is recommended to unearth the details,"" the report, sent by then Kasaragod SP , A Srinivas, who probed the Nimisha case in November 2015, said.

A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake. Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.

Very few people would agree that instead of celebrating Independence day as a day of festivity, we should observe it as a day of national shame.

But yes, things are happening in the colour of political agenda which is controversial. Every living creature is entitled to healthcare and that is something we should ask for...please don't drag cows or goats in between.

Do anyone think that Kejriwal is having the right approach to the centre. The massive mandate he got in Delhi was taken for granted by him to abuse others. Is this attitude good for a person like Kejriwal. It is absurd to think that what he says is unquestionable and what he does is right. In my opinion his popularity is showing a downward momentum. Can anyone who is inclined to AAP  show a single political party in India which is having foolproof credentials.	0
639	"If it is a matter of sleep for hindus then please have a look,,, As per Hinduism a true Hindu is one who is awake in Brahma Muhoorat & do not sleep during that time, Early Morning hours after 4 am is Brahma Muhoorat when a Hindu should not be sleeping.
ADHAN IS A MATTER OF FEW MINUTES. 
And according to science early wakeup keeps a person happy. while sleeping till late spoils ones health.
Well....it is a matter of fact in my area that some prayers in temples are held in early morning and chanting of mantras do take place on loudspeaker in the very early morning for quite a long time. Though it is an area of more than 95% of muslims, we never opposed it then why hindu orthodox destructive minds raising their eye-brows on a matter of only few minutes. Azan is being recited for a couple of minutes. Being a secular indian citizen, it's very much important to restrain these fascist forces and stop them to create an unhealthy environment for this secular and great country.

To boost the morale, the Indian commander told the troops on the wireless communication that Lahore is only 2 - 3 miles away. At that time, the communications were not encrypted and both forces could intercept each others' communication. One of the Pakistani soldier also heard this conversation from his bunker. There was a sign near the bunker which read ""Lahore - 14 Miles"". He got out from the bunker, took the sign and moved towards the advancing Indian troops for some yards and posted a modified sign there. It now read ""Lahore - 14.2 Bloody Miles ...

IS IT BECAUSE THAT THE MINORITIES OF PAKKISTAN as well a minority hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, jains ethnically cleansed even in s ecualr Kashmir state, ARE NOT CONSIDERED AS HUMAN BEINGS AND TREATED ONLY AS SACRIFICAL LAMBS???

AND WE CALL THIS GLOBAL SICKULARISM??? OR BIASED SECULARISM???

818	"Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake."	1

890	"Margaux S Milchen.The Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the United States of America and the Bey and Subjects of Tripoli of Barbary, Signed at Tripoli November 4, 1796, Article 11 has been established as a matter of contention between the English and Arabic translations of the Treaty.  Adams criticized the claims to universal authority made by the Roman Catholic Church, which may well be the foundation upon which wording of Article 11 were based.

While it is true that Adams signed the aforementioned Treaty, it should be noted that he also signed the Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights; both of which serve to further support Adams’ words as being misconstrued.  That Congress unanimously signed the Treaty is absurd when one acknowledges the whole translation issue.      

John Adams was both a devout Christian, and an independent thinker.  In a letter to Benjamin Rush, Adams credited religion with the success of his ancestors since their migration to the New World in the 1630s.  He also believed that regular church service was beneficial to man's moral sense. In 1796, Adams denounced political opponent  Thomas Paine's deistic criticisms of Christianity in The Age of Reason, saying, ""The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will.”  

In light of Adams’ Christianity, it is highly improbable that translations from English to Arabic were accurately transcribed.  It is far more plausible that he was rejecting the claims of “universal authority” proclaimed by the Roman Catholic Church than anything remotely dismissing the foundation upon the Christian religion.        

Adams twice served as the Vice-President under President George Washington.  The words of our esteemed first President, included in his Farewell Address, further dispute any notion that these United States of America are not founded upon the Christian religion; “And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.”

The words of James Madison, the Father of Our Constitution, clearly contradict the notion that America is not a Christian Nation; ”We have staked the whole of all our political Institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government, upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.”

While Puerto Rico is a territory of the U.S., they have yet to gain Statehood.  Indigenous languages have yet to take precedence over the English language in any of our States.  Your argument is a moot point until such time as they earn said Statehood.  We are all very much aware the U.S. is not Israel; restating the obvious is senseless, especially when it is irrelevant to the point at hand.  Perhaps it is you who “should read more?”"	0

899	"Statistics of phone freedom251.

291rs per phone. (251+40rs shipping)
x 6L order per second
= 17.46 cr

It was taking order till 12.15pm approx
I.e 6 hrs and 15 min which is 22,500 seconds

17.46 cr per sec x 22,500 sec
= 3,92,850 cr

3,88,494 cr was turnover of reliance industries in year 2014-15

That means within 6 hrs  15min they crossed turnover of reliance

Within 6 second tax audit become applicable to that company

And if we calculate interest on the said amount per day

3,92,850 cr x 4% x 1/365 (by taking minimum interest rate)
= 43.05 cr

And if after 4 months they will say we are unable to give product and refund 291rs to everyone
43.05 cr x 120 days approx
= 5,166 cr 
They will earn within 4 months by way of interest

Now you will say about their promotion cost

Deduct 50L,1 cr, 5 cr or even 50 cr, that will not make much difference to the figure"	0

What else is a fascist trait? Going after churches and places of worship? Putting limits on what people can say, even in the privacy of their own homes? Widespread domestic spying? All things done by the Obama administration and yet none of them would think to use the word fascist to describe those 8 years.

I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake."	1

Also the state government should provide the food (rice and Atta) from govt warehouse against the AADhar card. Why and what is the ThinkTank doing???

1151	y.   Indian Army band performs in Drass    WHEN WAS THE WAR FOUGHT?  The Kargil war, which commenced on May 1999, was announced after the infiltration of Pakistani troops and Kashmiri militants into Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir and along the Line of Control (LOC). The intrusion into the area, that divided the Indian territory of Ladakh from the northern areas of the state, had come as a complete surprise to the Indian army and Operation Vijay was immediately launched to flush our enemies from the Kargil sector.   Pakistani soldiers    MASTERMIND BEHIND THE ATTACK  Pervez Musharraf, the then Army Chief of Pakistan, is said to be the brain box behind the attack. Musharraf carefully charted out the intrusion plan, without any specifics from the then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. He was supported and assisted by Leiutenant General Mohammed Aziz. It is said that Musharraf executed the plan while Atal Bihari Vajpayee had responded to Nawaz Sharif's invitation to Lahore and where the duo signed the Lahore declaration.   Conventional modes of war were used    MODE OF FIGHTING  Well-equipped with war weapons, both sides were prepared to launch attacks on one another. The 18,000 feet high-altitude battle in the rocky terrain was fought under extreme low temperatures, in a conventional manner, despite both sides possessing nuclear weapons. India positioned five infantry divisions, five independent brigades and 44 battalions of paramilitary troops to Kashmir and further deployed 60 frontline aircrafts.   Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with army and air force officers salute at the India Gate on Vijay Diwas    THE INDIAN AIR FORCE  On May 24, 1999, it was decided that the operation would be joined by the Indian Air Force (IAF). However, it was stressed that the IAF would not cross the LOC at any cost. The IAF launched bomb attacks on the enemy within its boundary. Tiger Hill, one of the highest peaks in the Drass-Kargil area of the state, became the focal point during the war. After a fierce war of more than sixty days, and with the support of the international community, India recaptured Tiger Hill and pushed the Pakistani forces back into its territory.   School children display a national flag over a displayed Indian army tank to commemorate the day    INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE CONFLICT  Pakistan's infiltration to India and the military clash were deeply criticized by many countries and attracted the United States' intervention into the crisis. As per a report in the Daily Times, a leading newspaper in Pakistan, India gained the confidence of the US while Pakistan 'lost its credibility in the eyes of both India and Pakistan'. The international community began building pressure on the Pakistani forces and threatened them to withdraw or face isolation. Russia and Israel also came forward to support India's stance.

--- On November, 25 evening on a business TV channel ‘magic bricks NOW’ one of the panelist Justice (Ret) M F Saldanha said that in his housing society at Mumbai a lady had heart problem hence her family members and neighbors [including Justice (Ret) M F Saldanha] took her to a nearest private hospital but she died because her family did not have new cash currency to meet the demand of the hospital. 

A negligent driver is prosecuted and punished for killing a person by car / truck. The organizers / management of public functions / utilities are prosecuted and punished in case of fire due to negligence in which people get killed. Similarly the authorities / officials of Government and Reserve Bank of India should also be prosecuted and punished for negligence about demonetization which has allegedly killed ~ 70 persons, as mentioned at:- 

http://www.alwihdainfo.com/Opposition-protecting-Government-and-RBI-from-prosecution-under-Section-304-A-IPC-etc_a45304.html   

It is expected that Justice (Ret) M F Saldanha will take this matter to its logical / legal end and would get justice to the victim and her family, relatives and friends by getting the GOI & RBI (and hospital authorities) prosecuted for negligence etc about illegal demonetization program which has caused this death of the lady.

Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, “The cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of ‘Shraddha’ of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage.”

Indus Water Treaty Is Illegal
The case of the 1960 Indus waters treaty, it has been signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and “nowhere it is declared that the said agreement/treaty has been signed in the name of the President of India”, 
“According to the ministry of external affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India...,” 

“According to the impugned agreement 80% water goes to Pakistan which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India coupled with further financial and natural injuries to national interest.”

If We Indians Keep Quit Today Our Future Generations Will Blame Us And Never Going To Forgive Us

India Need Be Like China Fast And Furious And Must Have Ability To Say On Face.
China Claim South China Sea 
China Made And Develop 7 Artificial Man Made Islands On The South China Sea So Quickly 
Then Why Can't India Stop Water From Our Own States And Union Territories Of India
We Need To Build More Dam On Indus River And Must Have Iccha-Shakti To Say Only One Sentence To World Bank F*ck Off 
India Is Scraping Indus Waters Treaty

If China Can Do For Their Mother Land 
Then Why Not India (If India Cannot Do)
Then Their Is Some Serious Problem In Our Indian Government System With Our Political Partys And Also With Our Useless Politician.
Who Just Know To Bark But Cannot Take Action.

I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake."	1

1448	"What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoğan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoğan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under Erdoğan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.

Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoğan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil. still you Indian fooled by Saffron gay gangsters government panty GANG"	0

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

1791	It may appear rude to working mothers, but Mrs. Kapoor is just stating the fact that she is happy that she has the choice of being there for her child everyday. She understands that her love for her child is more important than the peer pressure of the times to get a job to boost one's ego. It may be difficult for the middle class working mothers to do the same, as they are working to supplement her husband's income and thus ensure a decent life for her family and dependents. It is a shame when wives of rich successful men, get jobs through their husband's recommendations and support, performing part-time mother duties. These positions could have been suitably filled by another needy person, man or woman, that could help another family overcome their hardships. Feminism is a joke in such cases.	1

1845	"Cow in Hinduism:

Eating Beef (Cow Mata) allowed in Hinduism.
Rigveda (10/85/13) declares, “On the occasion of a girl’s marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered.” 
Rigveda (6/17/1) states that “Indra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo.” 
Manusmriti (Chapter 5 / Verse 30) says, “It is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals, for Brahma has created both the eaters and the eatables.”
Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21) that, “I eat beef because it is very soft and delicious.”
Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, “The cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of ‘Shraddha’ of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage.”
Vashistha Dharmasutra (11/34) writes, “If a Brahmin refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of ‘Shraddha’ or worship, he goes to hell.”"	0

I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake."	1

2049	"I would like to mention here that about a month ago, I bought a car Vitara Breeza ZDI from One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow – 226005, having Vehicle Registration No. UP 32 HQ 5615.

The very next days after delivery of the car, I noticed some cloudy parts and bubbles on the driver and co-driver door of the car. then I spoke to the car dealership about the problem they notice the problem and send my car to their Maruti Suzuki Authorised service station on 02-01-2017 for fixing the problem.

After 15 days, the same problem was reoccurred. When I took my car to the Dealer (One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow – 226005) they again sent it to service station for rectification of the problems and delivered the car to me after two days.

The same problem has again been noticed on 13-02-2017. After just 20 days  again i.e. 24-02-17 the same problem has been noticed on the entire body of the car.

When I visit again the authorised service station of the dealership they refused to resolve the problem and misbehaved with me.

Today i.e. On 23.03.207 My car is still under repair with Oneup Moters Arambagh from last 20 days.

I brought the car for use my old parents and not to send it repeatedly to the service station for repairs or fixing problems. My father is suffering from heart ❤ problems. As you know it is very difficult to senior citizens or to repeatedly visit the service station."	0

The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.	1

2255	"If you know anybody who is screeching about Trump's ""islamaphobia"" or ""muslim ban"", perhaps they need to know a few things.

1. Sixteen muslim countries bar Israeli citizens from entering. Do any of those people, mentioned above, screech ""Jew phobia"" or ""Jew ban""? I think not.

2. There are Israeli citizens who are muslim. Those muslim Israeli citizens are barred from entering 16 muslim countries. Do any of those people, mentioned above, screech ""islamaphobia"" or ""muslim ban"" about those countries? Do they protest outside the embassies of those countries? I think not.

Perhaps anybody you encounter who accuses Trump of ""islamaphobia"" or a ""muslim ban"" should be made aware of those facts, mentioned above. Perhaps they should also be made aware that Trump's Executive Order is a temporary order and not permanent like that of the 16 other countries which have permanent bans.

Just for the further education of those who are being led by George Hitler Soros, here is the list of those countries which bar Israeli citizens from entering:

    Syria
    Iran
    Iraq
    Yemen
    Libya 
    Algeria
    Bangladesh
    Brunei
    Kuwait
    Lebanon
    Malaysia

42	"The #Antagonismविरोध friction 
Between Freedom of Speech and Seditious Libel in India

BJP dominated by RSS thru ABVP is trying protect their Government n their failed Policy of Hatred n intolerance in the shelter of #SaditionLaw: The law of sedition as provided for in Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, 124-A was imported from various sources- the Treason Felony Act (operating in Britain)

The fundamental difference between the former Section 124A and the present one is that in the former the offence consisted in exciting or attempting to excite feelings of “disaffection"" as punishable, but in the latter the act of “bringing or attempting to bring into hatred or contempt the Government of India"" has also been made punishable.
Mahatma Gandhi in 1922 was convicted under the same law in the famous- Great Ahmedabad Trial, in which Gandhi was charged with sedition i.e for “spreading and inciting disaffection"" against the then British-ruled government."	1

Black money is still being generated and some of it is being caught everyday and a lot of BJP members themselves are being caught - this shows that this move will never be able to control future generation of black money.

Black money should be wiped out, hoarders should be punished but this move will deliver non of that.

100	Akbar conquered Kashmir in 1587 AD. During his mughal rule the Hindus enjoyed security of person and property and were allotted high government posts. It was he, who, pleased with their intelligence, gave them the surname Pandit.[16] The Mughals rule was followed by that of Afghans. Gradually, many Kashmiris converted to Islam, leaving smaller population of Kashmiri Pandits who still practiced the Shaivite religion. Not much was done to win back the converts to Hinduism. The majority, though still remained Hindus in Jammu and Kashmir. Fact!!	1

The only thing he will bring to India bad reputation. Any bilateral business % goes to ISIS  DAESH from Erdogan side. . 

Interestingly he made this speech in India about Khilafat which's the dream of his terrorist ISIS proxies too. 
""President Erdogan said that he was delighted to accept the honorary degree from a university which has played a significant role not only in India's freedom movement but has also supported the >Khilafat< movement in the 1920s, while standing by the Turkish people and its founders.""
Although not sure which so called ""world-peace"" they are talking about! It's for sure it's not our world/ planet. The only thing this Erdogan contributed in our world has so long been terrorism and destruction.

127	"Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake."	1

186	"Why India Should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
Indus Water Treaty Is Illegal
The case of the 1960 Indus waters treaty, it has been signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and “nowhere it is declared that the said agreement/treaty has been signed in the name of the President of India”, 
“According to the ministry of external affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India...,” 

“According to the impugned agreement 80% water goes to Pakistan which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India coupled with further financial and natural injuries to national interest.”

If We Indians Keep Quit Today Our Future Generations Will Blame Us And Never Going To Forgive Us

India Need Be Like China Fast And Furious And Must Have Ability To Say On Face.
China Claim South China Sea 
China Made And Develop 7 Artificial Man Made Islands On The South China Sea So Quickly 
Then Why Can't India Stop Water From Our Own States And Union Territories Of India
We Need To Build More Dam On Indus River And Must Have Iccha-Shakti To Say Only One Sentence To World Bank F*ck Off 
India Is Scraping Indus Waters Treaty

If China Can Do For Their Mother Land 
Then Why Not India (If India Cannot Do)

All army personnel is accountable for their actions towards every person regardless of the opposing member being from an army member or a civilian.

Actions should not go unseen rather the matter should proceed in military courts, where an adequate military prison time can be allotted. It is very difficult for governing bodies to have any peace talks, where army personnel keep acting in such a barbaric manner. 

If they are so keen on fighting, then fight for the rights of citizens. In the honorable armies, there is no room for such actions.

Pray tell what did the British did in India for 400 years? They weren't out their picking potatos from the field were they? They raped, stole and oppressed India for over 400 years. So what gives you the right to talk about Islam on the basis of the actions of a few fruitcakes? In the words of Jesus (pbuh); ""He that is without sin shall cast the first stone"".

328	"Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.

381	Reporter:- PM sir; which fruit do you like? Modi:- Apple Reporter:- Breaking news--- Modi does not like Mangoes; Banana; etc. Let’s ask Congress their views on this. Manish Tewari:- Modi like Apple means Red color. This means he likes bloodshed This means he does not want peace and harmony in the country Ahmed Patel:- This means Modi is only promoting Hindutva. He does not like green fruits means he is against Muslims. This clearly shows Modi has no feelings for Muslims. Nitish Kumar:- This attitude of Modi is what made us split from NDA. Rahul Gandhi:- Modi never says which chocolate he likes. Arnab Goswami : The nation wants to know why Modi likes apple more than other fruits The Nation has the right to know this. Sonia Gandhi:- People of India please ask from where Modi is going to get the money to buy such an expensive fruit. Geelani:- This is Modi’s tactic to usurp Kashmir. We will not allow this to happen. Yechuri:- Selecting an expensive fruit like Apple shows Modi is pro- capitalist. It also means he is pro corporate and wants to promote Apple products indirectly. Why is he not saying about Samsung etc. We want a CBI enquiry. Kejriwal:- Traditionally Mango is considered the King of Fruits. Modi is anti tradition. This is against the interest of the aam aadmi. Foreign Media:- Modi’s communal policies are hurting the secular fabric of India. Common man - God save this country	1

590	"How to convert all your black money into white in 4 easy perfectly ""legal"" steps?
Answer:-
-> Step 1 - Create a political party, and get registered under Representation of People's Act, 1951. [Not a difficult task. There are more than 1000 registered parties who didn't even contest 2014 Lok Sabha Election, and EC cannot de-register a party]
-> Step 2 - Donate all your black money to your party in parts, each part should be less than 20,000. You can make infinite such donations, and say that they came from people.
[According to the RP Act 1951, the political parties are not required to report (to the Election Commission of India (ECI)) the name of the individuals or organizations from whom they have received donations of amount less than Rs.20,000.]
-> Step 3 - Go to bank, deposit all this amount in the party's account.
[No need to pay any income tax. Political parties are 100% exempted from income tax]
-> Step 4 - Withdraw the amount as and when you need, in 50/100/500/2000 rupee notes - It is all white.
[Since Political Parties are not under RTI, you can't ask them how they spent their money]
ENJOY YOUR WEALTH...!!!!
*Moral of the Story:- All political parties are same. All they do is follow the letter of law like above example & kill the spirit which is politically correct but ethically incorrect. But in the process teach you about how one can legally generate enormous wealth and still talk about ideals and concern for poor people.

You can fight for those women too who are not married because of high payment demand or those who burnt alive or those who got raped. When these issues will get resolved will then come back and talk of their rights you are pointing out. Meanwhile, those women can ask help that their husband cheated them that he did not follow the rule properly what was given to him. if you want to know the islamic rule of talaq please read it from any islamic authentic resouces.

Where were you 1-2 years back, when no one did wonder of triple talak or half of our population rights. You just got heard this base less issue by a politician and your mouth got opened. Triple talaq came recently 1-2 years back or 1400 years ago? Triple talaq is now common since 1-2 years right Mr. Ravi Sharma? Or this is just a political gimic to make people busy so that they do not talk of other common issues like GDP, Economical condition, Increasing prices, Unemployment, Farmer issues?"	1

733	"a) Karan neither has a niece nor a nephew who is a part of his company. Even aunts/uncles for that matter. And as a matter of fact, he has nurtured the likes of Nikhil Advani who did not belong to a filmy family. His crew has a lot of first generation professionals too. Shahrukh, Preity Zinta, Sidharth, Anushka, Fawad Khan, to name a few have featured in his movies in prominent roles. So the argument of nepotism is weak in my view. 
b) What you also need to understand. Karan runs a production house and the nature of work/hierarchy is very different than that of the usual corporates. 
c) Karan invests money into a film and as the creative head of his company, he has every right to cast whosoever he feels fits the bill and can contribute to the success of his film/attract audience. And like someone rightly pointed out, it is talent that will sustain at the end and if his choice of cast fails to impress the audience, it is his loss and as a businessman in the movies, he is smart enough to understand that dynamic.
d) Lastly, he has never shied away from praising the outsiders' work. In fact he also has no qualms in admitting that he is incapable of making certain kind of films that he thinks are brilliant and made by outsiders. His friendship with Anurag Kashyap is very strong and Kashyap has admitted how wrong a perception he had had about him just like many others until he came to know him."	0

It will be better if they just block big notes and just issues more small notes of Rs 1-100 for small transactions.

Do u know how safe it feel when u hear Azan in the morning ? Thieves and evil doers on road run away thinking that now worshippers will be up and on the way to mosques . 

Lots of people( vendors , beggars, stray irrespective of religions ) who don't have hi-tech mobiles to put alarm on , rely on Azan to wake up in the morning to start their day for food .
On an average Azan lasts for 1 minutes 30 seconds . Which is a call for prayers for muslims to wake up and remember God .  

1minutes and 30 seconds , is also not we are tolerant of now ? We as an Indians boast about being rich in culture and religions . If We start banning this Azan, bhajan Kirtan , or morning chanting in gurudwaras you know how depressing our morning could get . 

I am a Muslim and whenever I used to walk across the gurudwara in the morning , I used to peep in to admire how they start their morning with chanting and meditation. It's so soothing to the ears . I miss that india where we admire each other religions !"	1

1024	"Arvind Kejriwal's biggest weapon is his facade of righteousness and moral high-ground, both of which often get exposed unveiling his true identity. A substantial population of Delhi re-elected this stupid moron because of multiple factors (back-to-back BJP victories and too much of Hindutva, including gharwapsi, were some of the contributing factors) and not the charismatic persona of this hypocrite, if somehow you perceived it that way. His spit-and-run strategy also shows how politically immature this person is. Trust me, this guy never wanted to do anything, he merely wanted to be praised and idolized. But for what? At least, Modi has got a product to sell along with a proven track-record. What has Kejriwal got except his persistent allegations (and quite ironically, when he cannot even face the same against him and his party)?

Yes, it might be true he is quite daring. But he is as daring as Rakhi Sawant, both of whom come up with new theatrics and drama to keep the general public laughing. If you believe he retweeted it because it was more logical, please do explain how logical was it to oust Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan. He did it merely because he had no other option. If Vishwas quits, Kejriwal, along with Aam Aadmi Party, would probably die, decay, and sink into the bottomless chasm of politics which has seen many parties share a similar fate. Hope your leader comes up with some constructive politics in the future, which will not merely benefits him, but also the Indian political scenario. Otherwise, he is going to lose relevance completely (as it is apparent given his current trajectory)."	1

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

Two things in India prevalent are  subsidies and concessions. Both are corrupt orientated and noncompetitive. For all politicians, pseudo secular, left groups, demand for subsidy orientated programs for all rural, and urban people. All schemes of 100000 lakh crores are declared in each budget but poorly implemented through central agencies constituted by unprofessional, political, official, and middlemen nexus, who always fancy of corruption than the success of these schemes. Second our corporate groups, who wants concession of reduced corporate tax and excise/custom duty only without competition at par world standards. Those who challenge these groups may succeed to build India. Modi was looking for only whether he will break all conventional style of development approaches rather take  bold initiatives. Demonetization may be first step to make public use and transact their money through legal ways and transfer economy more formal without indirect control of black money holders as at present.

The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.	1

I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

2205	"A few words from the core my Heart... ============================== ============= Narender Modi is not a messiah as we all used to think but he is just another corrupt politician who has worn the mask of ""Harbinger of Good days"". Shame on him. He is doing nothing except making fool to our innocent countrymen. Now lemme prove my points. When Modi would campaign for his party BJP (bhartiye jumla party) in 2014 general election, he promised that he would solve the case of Naxalites/ Maoists. He promised that he would solve Kashmir issue and abrogate article 370. He promised that he would solve the problem of OROP for army men. He promised to rebut Pakistan in the harshest way possible. He promised to give we youngsters a job/a secured career. He promised to protect every woman from monsters. He promised to eliminate corruption. He promised to make India great again..He promised to bring LokPal...He promised to bring back black money from Swiss bank... But it's irony that he has done just opposite to what he had promised a couple of years ago. He has not fulfilled even a single promise that he made to us...I was also one of those who were die hard fan of Mr. Modi but today when I see the condition of our country, I feel jittery...I think he has cheated all of us... Our Jawans are being killed by bloody Naxals/Maoists or by incorrigible Pakistan..We youths are being deprived of jobs by scrapping many government posts and minimizing vacancy..This government is absolutely anti-government jobs...Farmers are committing suicide everyday...Women are being tortured openly...Nagaland and Kashmir are demanding freedom and shouting anti-India slogans in our national capital's JNU...China is making CPEC through Gilgit Baltistan without even caring for our concern.. I am asking u after all what do we have got by electing Mr. Modi ? Are we not cheated?? Still we all are happy and voting for Modi just because a few members of BJP are speaking against muslims and in support of Ram Mandir...Are we not fools?? Hating muslims is the only eligibility that forces us to support BJP?? Please realize the harsh truth that either BJP or Modi is not the party or the person we voted for..We have to change our perception...Our Jawans at the border are being mutilated and we are helpless..I am ashamed of my PM... Jai Hind....."	1
2206	Modi denying to pass Jan lokpal doesn't shattered your dream you piece of sh_t.?you haven't made announcement of your RSS joining....why that?The same AAP that shattered your dream are protesting with the framers from Tamilnadu at Jantar mantar for last 2 weeks almost....haven't heard that?who stopped you from joining them?are they antinational or you are hibernating for last three years.?	1

Not everyone is married to a celebrity. Many women have to work ti support their husbands and ensure a decent future for the kid. 

Madam, you are insulting them by saying that they treat the kids like puppies.

*To add*
You decide to bring a baby into the world and into your family. It is the same with puppies or any other pet for that matter.  Your pet is not for your recreation that you would spend one hour with them and run away. People who really bond with their pets treat them like their own kids.

Obviously you neither know much about keeping pets nor about motherhood."	1

2491	"Cow in Hinduism:

Eating Beef (Cow Mata) allowed in Hinduism.
Rigveda (10/85/13) declares, “On the occasion of a girl’s marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered.” 
Rigveda (6/17/1) states that “Indra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo.” 
Manusmriti (Chapter 5 / Verse 30) says, “It is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals, for Brahma has created both the eaters and the eatables.”
Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21) that, “I eat beef because it is very soft and delicious.”
Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, “The cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of ‘Shraddha’ of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage.”
Vashistha Dharmasutra (11/34) writes, “If a Brahmin refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of ‘Shraddha’ or worship, he goes to hell.”"	0

2559	"What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoğan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoğan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under Erdoğan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.

Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoğan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil. THE GREAT LEADERSHIP"	0

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

As peoples elect Government to lessen their pain not for elongation of it. Now if GoI sticks to Development then it has to apply Time Scale as mentioned just with Digital India or if they opt for populism then they will have to drastically bring down scope of Digital India as the count down for 2019 has begun.

2769	"Why India Should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
Indus Water Treaty Is Illegal
The case of the 1960 Indus waters treaty, it has been signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and “nowhere it is declared that the said agreement/treaty has been signed in the name of the President of India”, 
“According to the ministry of external affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India...,” 

“According to the impugned agreement 80% water goes to Pakistan which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India coupled with further financial and natural injuries to national interest.”

If We Indians Keep Quit Today Our Future Generations Will Blame Us And Never Going To Forgive Us

India Need Be Like China Fast And Furious And Must Have Ability To Say On Face.
China Claim South China Sea 
China Made And Develop 7 Artificial Man Made Islands On The South China Sea So Quickly 
Then Why Can't India Stop Water From Our Own States And Union Territories Of India
We Need To Build More Dam On Indus River And Must Have Iccha-Shakti To Say Only One Sentence To World Bank F*ck Off 
India Is Scraping Indus Waters Treaty

If China Can Do For Their Mother Land 
Then Why Not India (If India Cannot Do)
Then Their Is Some Serious Problem In Our Indian Government System With Our Political Partys And Also With Our Useless Politician.
Who Just Know To Bark But Cannot Take Action.

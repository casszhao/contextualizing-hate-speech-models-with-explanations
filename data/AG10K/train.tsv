19	"I salute every working woman who spend quality time with kids and excel at workplace too. Being a homemaker is her choice. That's it. I'm skeptical how magnanimous she may be to accept her husband's choice if he intends  to be a homemaker. 

Men also have equal rights to be at home or work. Most of the parents look for a groom who earns fat-some so that the woman gets the privilege to stay home.  Nobody is born to work. Irrespective of the gender, if one wants to take a backseat in their career, it's the other one's responsibility to take lead. Being a homemaker is one's choice and that privilege can be taken by both man and woman."	1

46	India must prevent Pak soldiers to cross LOC and their coming into India stealthily at all cost. For that purpose we should use bullets liberally.

74	"Undeniable facts about Muslim extremism:

Direct quotes from the Quran:
1. Quran: 4/89 : “They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike. So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah . But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper.” [Link: https://quran.com/4/89 ] Translation: Kill all Muslims who leave Islam.  
2. Quran: 2/1 : “Alif, Lam, Meem.” [Link: https://quran.com/2/1  ] Translation: Allah and his messengers are always right, and the Quran cannot be doubted”
3. Quran: 8/12 : “[Remember] when your Lord inspired to the angels, ""I am with you, so strengthen those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved, so strike [them] upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip"".” [Link: https://quran.com/8/12 , https://quran.com/8/60 ] Translation: Terrorize all non-believers and people who do not agree with Islam.
4. Quran: 98/6 : “Indeed, they who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of Hell, abiding eternally therein. Those are the worst of creatures.” [Link: https://quran.com/98/6 ] Translation: “People of the Scripture (Jews, Christian and Sabians) and Polytheists (Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains) are all vilest of creatures that deserve no mercy.”
5. Quran: 4/3  : “And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice].” [Link: https://quran.com/4/3] Translation: “Two, three, four..!!”
6. Quran: 5/51  : “O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.” [Link: https://quran.com/5/51] Translation: “Don’t make Jew and Christian friends ”
7. Quran: 2/216  : “Fighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you. But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah Knows, while you know not.” [Link: https://quran.com/2/216] Translation: “Fighting[Jihad] is Muslim’s obligation, even if you don’t want to”
8. Quran: 3/85  : “And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers..” [Link: https://quran.com/3/85] Translation: “Islam is the only acceptable religion”

Pork is banned all Islamic countries, except three. Muslim extremists say other religions are intolerant towards them and they have always been subject to INJUSTICE AND HATRED. May be true, but a very logical justification for this can be deducted by connecting the dots above as well as below... 

The Shoe Bomber was a Muslim

109	"The complaint that airtel is playing fool with customer: I had gone for plan change on my postpaid number 9789693896. I registered through the website. I was informed that the it will be confirmed in 4 hrs. I did not get any conformation whatsoever. Second time I attempted changing of plan got the same response that this will be confirmed in 4 hrs. Again nothing was received as confirmation or whatsoever. Suddenly an hour back I received a call from chennai saying that the plan change has not taken place and I was advised to contact the call center. When informed to the call center none were capable of doing anything the call was transferred to the manager and he repeated whatever the earlier fellows was saying that was ultimately of no use.
If I change plan all the benefits like free internet package offers that was there will be removed. That is the only contention and they refuse take up the request of the plan change in between such that it takes effect on from next billing cycle. but earlier it was done for withdrawing a package but it had an effect on next billing cycle.
Every time they create problem and we have to suffer. Call center or the voice support is simply useless as we have to spend our valuable time listening to their nonsense blah...blah and repeated automated messages.
It is really doubtful that airtel is really interested in resolving the issues of the customer."	1

Even Mussolini or Hitler will shudder if they see the method of murders this inhuman party did. They failed miserably in West Bengal. Now many right thinking citizens are rejecting the polarisation jumla of both Congress who are habitual corrupt and Communists whose DNA is political murders and joining BJP refusing to be mislead by their Vote Bank Lies of communalism. Vijayan's party as well Cingress are scared and worried about the erosion of their cadres to BJP and hence unleashed a dirty devilish Malicious  Communal Campaign coupled with murders and clashes on BJP. But this has become outdated and Congress is swept to a corner in Centre. Same experience will meet CPIM and Congress again.	1

174	"See the stupidity of indian PM who is worried about summer instead of country 

In the 31st edition of 'Mann Ki Baat', Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation on a number of topics and issues including VIP culture in our country, bridging the gap between rich and poor, and also encouraging students to try new things during their summer vacations. However, one piece of advice that has really touched a chord with people on social media is PM Modi's suggestion on putting out water for birds and animals this summer. With temperatures soaring across the country, PM Modi suggested children take up this initiative as it will not only help the creatures but also instill empathy in children."	1

184	This budget is loudly saying that DEMONETIZATION was a damp squib. If concessions in taxation is given there would loss of revenue to the government. Unless there are ways to make good this loss, concessions cannot be given. Had demonetization been successful in curbing the black money, the govt. would have had extra revenue to allow concession in personal taxation. Since the concession in this score is nominal, if not negative taking inflation into account, it is written on the face of the Union Budget, 2017 that there is very little success in curbing the black money by demonetization.  On the other hand govt. needed money for several welfare schemes and definite sources to raise this money. Since independence salaried class is the most certain source of tax revenue and thus govt. decided to take it for a ride for another time. The persons who got delighted thinking that the ill gotten  wealth of the dishonest people in their neighbourhood would now be caught, are probably still not aware of it. If they are still delighted by seeing the budget analysis on TV and think that this budget is a great booster for rural and infrastructure sector here is one statistics. Last year allocation to railways was Rs.1.21 lakh crores; this year due to the so-called thrust on infrastructure the amount is 1.31 lakh crore. If this allocation is discounted for inflation the figure seems to be less than that of the last year.	1

200	The reason the police in India is socially isolated from the general public and it is a taboo to visit a police station is because police are not looked on as human beings...  They are either cruel robots who execute orders or they are brave superhumans who got the job done..  There is no in between for us in the society...  Why are we not allowed to be human...??? Is it because to err is human???  People talk about Human Rights what about our Human Rights???  Why can't we have a bad day at work and sulk while all the other professionals can why can't we cry when we are hurt?  Why can't we smile when we want to...??? It is because of this mentality that the country's police is being socially isolated to the extent of disattachment from society...	1

What solution he has for all of us, in his video, And what does he mean to say on Kashmir or Pakistan. should Modi send army and start killing terrorist or attacking Pakistan for which militants will stand, Ok army will kill militants and jihadis, then what, did he said anything about so called secular, presstitutes, jaichands of nation or NGOs around the world which will defame India and world will apply trade sanctions on India. Yes India can survive with trade sanctions but what about OIL, Technology whcih is must needed to grow in 21st Centuary. Don't think this will not happen. Look at Syria's Sia leader Assad who is been targeted all around the world just because it is said that he is killing innocent Sunni. So how many sunni did he kill may be thousand but what america, europe doing with him.
So what will happen when Indian armies goes to Kashmir or Pakistan and start killing all. World Powerful countries, NGOs, Jaichands, Political Parties all will criticize India and World may apply trade sanctions on India.
Indian army and PM is capable of fetching POK and killing terrorist, militants from Kashmir . Our internal system has damages and holes, but govt. is working it.
This whole Matter has to be solved properly by laws, making India Permanent member of UN, Entering into NSG, making Indian economy more powerful and self dependent, maintaining our culture, making politics clean. Modi is doing all this.
What Kumar Vishwas is saying we all know this excluding his poems, But what he is doing in Kanhaya, Jaichands supporting Aam Aadmi Party than, indirectly may or may not be taunting Modi or trying to create aura like central govt. is doing nothing .
While the fact is this government after 70 yrs is working to solve problems."	1

370	That is not going to solve the problem. We are not limited to MP and MLA elections, we have so many other elections like local body elections, by-elections, etc., and so on. We need to eliminate as many elections as possible because that will reduce the scope for fake currency as well. If an elected representative dies in office, the runner-up candidate should be given the responsibility rather than conducting another election. An elected government can't fall at the behest of few selfish politicians. We need to change rules to make the elected representatives to complete the term or even share power across party lines when there is no clear majority. Conducting elections after elections are bleeding this country.	1

398	"Doucett Black.  Your atheism is out of place in this Christian Nation in which you live.

Before wasting time dredging up the whole “separation of Church and State” fallacy, consider the words of James Madison, the Father of Our Constitution:

”We have staked the whole of all our political Institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government, upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.”

The man who authored our Constitution did not leave any room for doubt about governing ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.  The Congressional records further Christianity as the established religion of these United States of America:   

The process of drafting the First Amendment made the intent of the Founders abundantly clear; for before they approved the final wording, the First Amendment went through nearly a dozen different iterations and extensive discussions. 

“We do not want in America what we had in Great Britain: we don’t want one denomination running the Nation.  We will not all be Catholics, or Anglicans, or any other single denomination.  We do want God’s principles, but we don’t want one denomination running the Nation.”

This intent was well understood, as evidenced by court rulings after the First Amendment. In 1799 the court declared, “By our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion; and all sects and denominations of Christians are placed on the same equal footing.” 

The U.S. Almanac, while a respected publication, does not constitute the ultimate authority.  Our Founding Fathers, speaking through the U.S. Constitution, hold such authority.  Their position on the topics at hand is indeed upheld by the Supreme Law of the Land, as evidenced by the U.S. Supreme Court.  Perhaps it is you who is “stupid” and needs to educate yourself?"	1
399	"All that is fine, but as PM what did he do? 
1. Travel foreign
2. Do election campaign/rally (remember almost 2 dozen ministers were in UP, were they elected for this)
3. Implement UPA schemes which he shamelessly opposed earlier
Can anyone talk about it?
In UPA if some MP had criminal background there will be a big TRP debate in shameless media, now anyone dares to talk about Amit Shah

Walk on!
In foreign lands
Away from relatives and friends!

And your intelligence are your assets.
Your family values are your 
inheritance!
The climb has been arduous
Full of pain and frustrations.
 But you never gave up
You never lost hope!
You reached the summit
You can now enjoy the sunshine
You smile and you remember
This world is enjoyed by heroes!
You have brought honour
To your family and Motherland
And your work would serve 
The common man!

556	He is past his prime in Bollywood. He hardly gets to sing for a movie. The new singers have made their way and occupied Central place in playback singing which he enjoyed sometime back. So, now he is frustrated and desperate coz no one is talking about him and his vocals. Hence, the best way possible for him like all losers is talk against Islam and Muslims to get noticed. My request to Muslims wud be to ignore this defeated soul and leave him with his madness and frustration.	1

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

906	"Welcome Sir
Please kindly make it convenient to be spared my experiences as a Self Employed Er. Entrepreneur :
My life with family as an Er. Entrepreneur have been spoiled due to Dubious Actions by Vengeful Officials of corrupted  ISI, SBI, KFC, etc.
From 1982 to 1997, they have played with my life as an SSI unit proprietor. 
During 1990, I tried justice  from ISI and SBI through Kerala State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission  and in 1992,  an appeal filed with National CDRC, both Commissions having Judicial as well as Non Judicial Officers found some technical reasons to deny me Justice. I had no advocate to sue my plight. All members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and obligation towards the system, I became silent and continue efforts to revive and rehabilitation of my Sick SSI unit with full cooperation of Industries Department.
On 7.7.1995, I paid to KFC on One Time Settlement in full spirit of letter  of KFC dated 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupted Officials, the unit taken over by Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 was kept with custody of KFC.
I was at  Head Office of  KFC, Trivandrum  after my OTS payment, till a road accident at Palauan over Trivandrum on 6.3.97. 
I was under treatment from Medical College  Trivandrum, Kannur District Hospital, City Hospital Mangalore, etc and in least of 1997, I visited KFC  HO with the help Crutches, and realised that instead of blood, water is flowing through the Officials and the same day visit Kerala State CDRC and very next day filed a complaint against KFC. After three months, the Commission received reply from KFC with copy to me. On the basis of KFC's reply, the Commission started dictating Judgement and Dismissed my Complaint directing to Sue in Civil Court.
Next day I filed a Review Petition besides few other. The Hearing Day when I stand with help of Crutches and started to express my view, the Commission President threatened on huge cost to be Ordered against me. I managed to escape the so called Consumer Court with fear. 
But still I know that any one have common sense will award justice to me from National and State CDRC on both cases. 
After ,1977 to 2009, I was under acute mental depression.
I started writing to Central And State Governments and hence passed 5 pages G O, in 2010 direct KFC to settle issues at Board Level and to write to various Ministries of Government of India to enquire and compensated me due to Dubious Actions by ISI and SBI. 
But my efforts continue yet, the Corrupted Officials also continue to resist my efforts at my 67th age. 
What we understand from the synopsis of plight- 
Officials have good salary and support from all cadre of Government to save corrupted ones with the backing of so called Provision in court both Judicial and Quasi Judicial, like CDRCs, Human Rights Commissions, etc.

My plight covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc.. and are at my face book account.
Shall I await for an early justice from the Authorities concerned within my last days and which will light to effectively to formation of New safety measures to self employed personals and prevent such bad experiences suffering by me and family.

 Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake."	1

972	What manmohan did was fir generations not for himself. People with short sight will never see that. If given right I will choose him again and again. For ur kind information indias true nuclear potential will be achieved bcoz this man faught with everyone in this world formally and diplomatically to get india what it wanted and the entire world was shocked how india got the nuclear treaty signed. He waived off loans of the farmers who are the backbone of this economy not like the current pm.who waived off 7000 crores of just 63 people. There is a big gap when it comes to how an economist thinks for a nation and how a greedy politician thinks.	1

I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.

1276	"A Question of Order
India, Turkey, and the Return of Strongmen

What happens when a democratically elected leader evolves into an authoritarian ruler, limiting press freedom, civil liberties and religious and ethnic tolerance?

India and Turkey are two of the world’s biggest democracies—multi-ethnic nations that rose from their imperial past to be founded on the values of modernity. They have fair elections, open markets, and freedom of religion.

Yet this is an account of how the charismatic strongmen Narendra Modi, in India, and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in Turkey, used the power they had won as elected heads of state to push their countries toward authoritarian ways."	1

 Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake."	1

Indus Water Treaty Is Illegal
The case of the 1960 Indus waters treaty, it has been signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and “nowhere it is declared that the said agreement/treaty has been signed in the name of the President of India”, 
“According to the ministry of external affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India...,” 

“According to the impugned agreement 80% water goes to Pakistan which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India coupled with further financial and natural injuries to national interest.”

If We Indians Keep Quit Today Our Future Generations Will Blame Us And Never Going To Forgive Us

India Need Be Like China Fast And Furious And Must Have Ability To Say On Face.
China Claim South China Sea 
China Made And Develop 7 Artificial Man Made Islands On The South China Sea So Quickly 
Then Why Can't India Stop Water From Our Own States And Union Territories Of India
We Need To Build More Dam On Indus River And Must Have Iccha-Shakti To Say Only One Sentence To World Bank F*ck Off 
India Is Scraping Indus Waters Treaty

If China Can Do For Their Mother Land 
Then Why Not India (If India Cannot Do)
Then Their Is Some Serious Problem In Our Indian Government System With Our Political Partys And Also With Our Useless Politician.
Who Just Know To Bark But Cannot Take Action.

In our opinion we are on a brink of a global collapse there will be a cyclical recession in the time period of 2016-2018.

Global events that will exacerbate the recession:

- IMF's Foreign Reserve basket adds Chinese Yuan to its Forex basket reducing Euro's contribution to this basket by a considerable 7%+
- Euro will considerable depreciate 
- BREXIT - British Voters will actually vote for Britain to leave the EU
- US Elections and it's uncertainty.
- Crude Oil Glut
- China Debt-to-Equity conversion 
- Shemitah year of 2016

A Major global sell off should have happened on 2 October 2016 but as that is a Sunday on 3 October 2016, which is a Monday we will witness a global sell off and Global markets will correct in excess of 8%+ 

Targets in the range on 2016-2018
(All prices are in Rupees

Sensex: 18000-19000
Nifty: 6200-6400
Bank Nifty:8500-9000
ICICI bank: 110-120
SBI: 95-105

Google ""Shemitah Year 2016"" we are headed for the biggest blobal recession yet.
You have the opportunities to either become rich or become poor. 

Sit on cash don't buy anything right now.
Until, we reach the above Targets, you should sit on cash.

Welcome to Shemitah Year 2016.
Either you become rich or you become extremely poor the choice is yours the market has already dropped so much from 2014 that all gains have been wiped out and now we are in negative."	0

Unless these issues are not dealt with we cannot hope to see light at the end of tunnel.  Even after 7 decades we are still talking of unscientific form of reservations.  How stupid of our rogue politicians ? They still continue with same malpractice.  We need reservations based on economic backwardness and proper financial assitance with incentives ( like free education, food and material support, employment  etc). When this gap is reduced, things will start falling in line. This Cannot be achieved in a day . At least we can have hope.	1

1490	USA, UK, GERMANY, FRANCE and many other countries follow state religion, while they allow other faiths to coexist. However laws of the land are strictly followed regardless of ones religion and no concessions are given. None of the Islamic countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,Iran, etc., have churches or temples but in the guise of secularism India has given Muslim followers unlimited liberties of loud sparks for their calls to prayers, subsidies to travel to Macca Madina and various other financial helps. Yet this community, many of them, are dissatisfied. In that case Indian govt should allow them to migrate to Pakistan Banladesh or any other. Muslim country which will take them. Those who support secularism, can also try and emigrate to other countries of their choice if they will be accepted. Creators of constitution have committed biggest blunder and its interpreters of this secularism are propagating this blunder to help their vote bank which is a great shame.	0

1559	Does the cow protection movement also include murdering people Mrs. Nirmala sitaraman? Or is it the government's job to punish accusers? R we still fighting the freedom struggle? Or are we  today citizens of an independent democracy better known as india? Worship the cow dont kill it its holy and we consider her as our mother. But we also love and respect our fellow Indians they r our brothers and we expect justice for our brother(pehlu khan, a dairy farmer) and his family for this brutal murder is broad day light. So I urge the government to condemn this act and to ensure justice is given to those who deserve it before Indians of free and independent india lose faith in their democracy and its justice system.

Eating Beef (Cow Mata) allowed in Hinduism.
Rigveda (10/85/13) declares, “On the occasion of a girl’s marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered.” 
Rigveda (6/17/1) states that “Indra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo.” 
Manusmriti (Chapter 5 / Verse 30) says, “It is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals, for Brahma has created both the eaters and the eatables.”
Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21) that, “I eat beef because it is very soft and delicious.”
Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, “The cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of ‘Shraddha’ of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage.”
Vashistha Dharmasutra (11/34) writes, “If a Brahmin refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of ‘Shraddha’ or worship, he goes to hell.”"	1

1) Like aadhar card make it mandatory to have ATM/Debit Card.
2)Every business outlet small or big shall have swiping machines/paytm like arrangement. It must be made mandatory to run business.
3)Stop printing Rs.2000/_ immediately. And in future Rs.500/- . If not demonitize them six months before every election. All elections hence shall be conducted on the same date henceforth.
4)like indirect taxes integration, integrate all direct taxes & collect them through transaction tax from bank as arthakranti suggested. 
5) Continue cash withdrawal restrictions even after Dec 31st. 2016. Reduce cash usage eventually and limit to Rs.5000/- per month to individuals and Rs.20000/- to 100000/- to businesses as per their turnover.
6) Gst shall be collected at first billing. Stop input credit and collect turnover tax basing on turnover of distribution, service providers, and other small businesses.

In our opinion we are on a brink of a global collapse there will be a cyclical recession in the time period of 2016-2018.

Global events that will exacerbate the recession:

- IMF's Foreign Reserve basket adds Chinese Yuan to its Forex basket reducing Euro's contribution to this basket by a considerable 7%+
- Euro will considerable depreciate 
- BREXIT - British Voters will actually vote for Britain to leave the EU
- US Elections and it's uncertainty.
- Crude Oil Glut
- China Debt-to-Equity conversion 
- Shemitah year of 2016

A Major global sell off should have happened on 2 October 2016 but as that is a Sunday on 3 October 2016, which is a Monday we will witness a global sell off and Global markets will correct in excess of 8%+ 

Targets in the range on 2016-2018
(All prices are in Rupees

Sensex: 18000-19000
Nifty: 6200-6400
Bank Nifty:8500-9000
ICICI bank: 110-120
SBI: 95-105

Google ""Shemitah Year 2016"" we are headed for the biggest blobal recession yet.
You have the opportunities to either become rich or become poor. 

Sit on cash don't buy anything right now.
Until, we reach the above Targets, you should sit on cash.

Welcome to Shemitah Year 2016.
Either you become rich or you become extremely poor the choice is yours the market has already dropped so much from 2014 that all gains have been wiped out and now we are in negative."	0

1758	"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/ 

 Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake."	1

The Article in drafted in part xx1 of the constitution : temporary, Traditional  and special provision. ( **** means if Indian constitution or Indian Parliament not accept these provision then automatically Article 370 is no valve and not valid, and ready to delete from Indian constitution )

Dr. Br. Ambedkar Garu the principal drafted of the Indian constitution, had refused to draft Article 370.(**** Dr. Br. Ambedkar Garu said Jammu&Kashmir state is integral part of India so no need special autonomous )

Jammu & Kashmir accession to India dated 26 October 1947 since then it was Indian State. So need to delete Article 370 by Indian Constitution for better governance.

I request and say to Prime Minister of India Respected Narendra Modi please look after these Article 370 and delete immediately in our Indian Constitution and Jammu & Kashmir State people wants Business Corridor, Industrial Hub and relationship with South and North States, regarding this issues please take necessary step and co-operate.....Jai Hind

1844	Jha DarshFor those who still brainwashed to think that terrorism has religion...........Which terror organisation did max no of terrorist attacks in the world ???? It's ULFA they r Hindus not Muslims.  They did 749 conformed terrorist attacks .which terror organisation did maximum no of killings in the world ??? It's LTTE they killed more than 60000 innocents ( 3 times than Isis) . LRA Christian terrorist organisation killed more innocents than Alkhyda . Have ever seen it in western media . It's a western media propaganda to portray all terrorist as Muslim . In reality there r dormant nonmuslim terror organisation across the world like IRA ETA Antimatter Bala Maoists KKK The raising path etc..	1

1847	Mr Jaitley has to do some balancing  acts in view of the upcoming assembly polls.The union budget is not expected to be entirely corporate friendly.The govt. is considering waiving off interest on loans taken by farmers .A marginal rise in train fares is likely  as the govt. is considering providing social security to coolies who constitute unorganised work force. More than 70 percent of indirect tax collections  has come from the oil and gas sector which has seen rise in international prices.The govt. should stop announcing immunity for black money hoarders any more as frequent announcements of immunity raises question about the strength of govt.'s enforcement machinery.	0

2055	"What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoğan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoğan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under Erdoğan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.

Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoğan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil. Indian fooled by Saffron gay gangsters government"	1

Here some people are depend by terrorist Organisations and Pakistan MILITENTS and other Anti National Elements. Now they people are making  stone pelting on Army and Police and they raised slogans favor to Anti National attitude and wearing ISIS dressess and with Pakistan flags.

J&K State students need to get admissions in South INDIA Collages because there is no mutual understanding and interaction between j&k state and South states, In my verdict this is the big salvation for intolerance.

Need marriage proposals between South and North with j&k state people.

J&K State suffer by Lobour Acts and implementations because there is no route map for life survive with good opportunities this is the major problem in j&k State that's why teenagers following unlawful Act.

Need Industrial Hub in J&K state for better earnings.

I request to Prime Minister MODI Ji that, please bring the new reforms for j&k state for better future to our Citizens....Jai Hind

Manusmriti (Chapter 5 / Verse 30) says, “It is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals, for Brahma has created both the eaters and the eatables.”
Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21) that, “I eat beef because it is very soft and delicious.”
Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, “The cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of ‘Shraddha’ of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage.”

2201	"ARUNACHAL PRADESH, INDIA - HIDDEN GATEWAY for CHINA'S NEED OF SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL RIPARIAN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM 
=======================================

Arunachal Pradesh of india, the land of rising sun, undisputed beauty queen of Nature & powerhouse of hydropowers is always been a bone of contention between India & China.

But why china is so adament to have Arunachal Pradesh as part of Tibet ? Is it mere Riligioustic or Geo-politics or Militaristics or Expansionist mindset of China ? Why China is playing a zero-sum game knowing fully well that India will not part with Arunachal Pradesh  at any cost ? 

It is undoubtedly clear to everybody that the CORE GROWTH ENGINE of china's economy has been SUSTAINABLE RIPARIAN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM which has two componants as LOCAL & GLOBAL features. 

It is the GLOBAL FEATURE which makes ARUNACHAL PRADESH of India via NAGALAND as GATEWAY for china to the SHORTEST riparian transportation system based upon RIVER KALADIN of MYANMAR to the BAY of BENGAL (through Sittwe Sea Port of Myanmar which will eventually form KOLKATA-DHAKA-SITTWE economic corridor powered by 'BANGLADESH-BHUTAN-INDIA-NEPAL MULTILATERAL HIGHWAY' linked with INDIA-MYANMAR-THAILAND TRILATERAL HIGHWAY thereby effectively replacing NORTH EAST of INDIA as HUB of ACT EAST POLICY of INDIA with BENGAL, INDIA) as current global riparian transportation system takes too much times & distances to cover. That is why CHINA keeps disputing the ARUNACHAL PRADESH thereby giving much irritation to the India and preventing both powerhouses to realise full mutual prosperities.

But this ZERO-SUM game can be reversed by MIGHTY RIVER BRAHMAPUTRA. Having RORO facility at DHUBURI & elevated the status of DHUBURI, ASSAM, INDIA to the status of INTERNATIONAL SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE , river brahmaputra can provide peaceful & sustainable riparian solution to above discussed problem and for this both India & China Government have to build following multilateral economic corridor powered by inland, road & rail networks (taking both Bangladesh & Bhutan Government on-board) , namely , ""DHAKA-DHUBURI-THIMPHU-LHASA-BEIJING (DDTLB) ECONOMIC CORRIDOR ""."	1
2202	Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal.  A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).  We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.	1

2238	"Narender Modi is not a messiah as we all used to think but he is just another corrupt politician who has worn the mask of ""Harbinger of Good days"". Shame on him. He is doing nothing except making fool to our innocent countrymen. Now lemme prove my points. 
When Modi would campaign for his party BJP (bhartiye jumla party) in 2014 general election, he promised that he would solve the case of Naxalites/Maoists. He promised that he would solve Kashmir issue and abrogate article 370. He promised that he would solve the problem of OROP for army men. He promised to rebut Pakistan in the harshest way possible. He promised to give we youngsters a job/a secured career. He promised to protect every woman from monsters. He promised to eliminate corruption. He promised to make India great again..He promised to bring LokPal...He promised to bring back black money from Swiss bank...
But it's irony that he has done just opposite to what he had promised a couple of years ago. He has not fulfilled even a single promise that he made to us...I think he has cheated all of us...
Our Jawans are being killed by bloody Naxals/Maoists or by incorrigible Pakistan..We youths are being deprived of jobs by scrapping many government posts and minimizing vacancy..This government is absolutely anti-government jobs...Farmers are committing suicide everyday...Women are being tortured openly...Nagaland and Kashmir are demanding freedom and shouting anti-India slogans in our national capital's JNU...China is making CPEC through Gilgit Baltistan without even caring for our concern..
I am asking u after all what do we have got by electing Mr. Modi ? Are we not cheated?? Still we all are happy and voting for Modi just because a few members of BJP are speaking against muslims and in support of Ram Mandir...Are we not fools?? Hating muslims is the only eligibility that forces us to support BJP?? 
Please realize the harsh truth that either BJP or Modi is not the party or the person we voted for..We have to change our perception...Our Jawans at he border are being mutilated and we are helpless..I am ashamed of my PM...

2257	"Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake."	1

2404	"Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.

2601	"Why India Should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
Indus Water Treaty Is Illegal
The case of the 1960 Indus waters treaty, it has been signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and “nowhere it is declared that the said agreement/treaty has been signed in the name of the President of India”, 
“According to the ministry of external affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India...,” 

“According to the impugned agreement 80% water goes to Pakistan which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India coupled with further financial and natural injuries to national interest.”

If We Indians Keep Quit Today Our Future Generations Will Blame Us And Never Going To Forgive Us

India Need Be Like China Fast And Furious And Must Have Ability To Say On Face.
China Claim South China Sea 
China Made And Develop 7 Artificial Man Made Islands On The South China Sea So Quickly 
Then Why Can't India Stop Water From Our Own States And Union Territories Of India
We Need To Build More Dam On Indus River And Must Have Iccha-Shakti To Say Only One Sentence To World Bank F*ck Off 
India Is Scraping Indus Waters Treaty

If China Can Do For Their Mother Land 
Then Why Not India (If India Cannot Do)
Then Their Is Some Serious Problem In Our Indian Government System With Our Political Partys And Also With Our Useless Politician.
Who Just Know To Bark But Cannot Take Action.

I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake."	1

2770	"Q1) Are GDP data fudged?

- Yes, they are. They aren't accurate. They are being fudged to promote a lie.

Q2) Can you prove that the GDP data are fudged?

- Until January'2015, Indian economy was witnessing its worth growth since the mid 1980s. And then the magic happened. The Central Statistical Office (CSO) changed the way it calculates GDP saying that it was necessary to do so keeping in view the global practices. As a result, India outpaced China and became the fastest growing economy. In 2013-14 our economy grew at 6.9%, rather than 4.7%, which the CSO data showed earlier. Even the country's chief economic advisor, Arvind Subramanian, said “I am puzzled by the new GDP growth numbers. The revised numbers show GDP growth rose from 4.7% to 5.1% for 2012-13 and from 5% to 6.9% for 2013-14. This means acceleration in GDP growth of 1.9 percentage points in 2013-14, just by comparing the new numbers across time"". He also said ""these numbers, especially the acceleration in 2013-14, are at odds with other features of the macro economy"". Almost every economic expert, working in or out of the government ( including Mr Raghuram Rajan), questioned the GDP numbers as they found that the ground realities reflected a completely opposite picture. The new GDP numbers seemed completely in conflict with other economic indicators. According to R Nagraj , an independent member of the sub-committee that examined the new methodology to estimate output, the version adopted by the Central Stastical Organisation differed dramatically from the report finalised by the sub-committee in September 2014.

Q3) What about the latest GDP data released post-demonetization?

- They too are fudged. While the performance of few sectors have been better when compared to their performance in previous quarters, the huge improvement in private consumption (almost doubled) seems highly doubtful amidst the cash crunch during demonetization. It seems that the CSO hasn't been able to map the demonetization effect in its data. Both the government and RBI have also been saying ( just like few of their sensible critics) that the effect of demonetization can be mapped over a longer time-frame. Also, the CSO revised DOWN the Q3 estimates of 2015-16 by 0.3 percentage point to 6.9% from 7.2% earlier, which led to considerable improvement in Q3 2016-17 figures. For those who don't find it surprising, the CSO revised UP Q1 and Q2 estimates of 2015-16. This downward revision of Q3 of 2015-16 has helped in restricting the effect of demonetization in figures.

Q4) I am not able to understand anything. Why?

- You won't be able to get it. You are neither a statistician nor an economist. Everytime reports and claims like these surface, hustle a little bit on internet beyond Facebook and Twitter, and read about basic things and what experts have to say about them.

Q5) But Modi ji says experts know nothing. Don't you think that he is right?

- After Hindutva, the best tactic Modi ji has got is misinformation. He has convinced people in believing that experts know nothing. He misinforms people who don't know anything but to believe him. They don't have enough time or will to find out the truth.

2778	"'vaidya shaala'/ वैद्यशाला - THE RIGHT WORD
Certain biblical & other terms were modified by Christian Missionaries to sound as if Indian, in order to penetrate their religious activities.
'Hospital' was one among them. It was changed as 'aspataal' in North & 'aasupatri' in South. But, it is appropriate that we shall give up that pseudonym & use our native word 'vaidya shaala'/ वैद्यशाला!
vaidya shaala/ वैद्यशाला, davaakhaana/ दवाखाना & hospiTal/ हास्पिटल are correct words.

Stunning thing is that the parents of the girl lodged missing report on the same day and girl was killed on railway track on 8-12-12 & police recovered the body on the same day. Police has no time to even collect her PM report & investigation is yet not started to allow the culprits to erase the evidences. No news paper/channel dared to show the news as it has no worth for them. A police person was killed in agitation at India Gate and PM report came to police within 24 hours and MS of Ram Manohar Lohiya Hospital is summoned by the police to be appear in their office.	1

They have all done good jobs.  Take the case of Gujarat. More than 95 percent the industries including  IPCL, Amul, Reliance to name few were established during the past govts. You must be thankful to them. If they hadn't done it you would not have been able to enjoy the chief Ministership of Gujarat. Similarly because of the good work done by the earlier govts you are now enjoying the Primeministership. Otherwise you would not have been able to make this kind of foreign tours and waste taxmen's hard earned money.  So the humble request to you is not to make voulger comments against past govts and leaders.  One day you will also become "" X "" Prime Minister."	1

These facts explains that these terrorists are not Muslims (in the real sense of the word) but paid proxy armies, nurtured, protected, assisted bt the greatest Terrorists the world has ever seen - Israel, America and GB.
This is the truth, the absolute   truth only known by knowledgeable people. We are all being taken for a long windy ride to make the world believe what  what they want us to believe.  Unfortunately a huge percentage of the world's population took the bait, hook, line and sinker."	1

2921	"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake"	1

2929	He has right to make complain about anything, that's true it's noise or sound pollution so far. Some of you are written that giving them respect without making complain. In Europe, they won't creat sound from religious institutions. It does mean also they respect each of them. Moreover it depends how civilized you are the way you living your life more than religion. Religion doesn't make you great human if you are not yourself . You must hear song or music and it doesn't bother you rarely Azan does. I would say, from all religious institutions right now to stop making noise or pollution, not particularly Azan. Pray for your God deeply without bothering or annoying someone. Over thousand year religion brings war more than peace remember dumb religious.	1

I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake."	1

This is alarming call to Muslim community to come forward to give up religious clericness by protesting agst inhuman acts of terrorists to killing innocent people in name of jihad instead of giving them silent support by keeping silent for their anti humanity acts.

3382	"Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake."	1

Modi is failed bringing the black money back and completely failed handling the situation and the GDP is has gone down by 1.2%. It will take 5 years for the indian economy to come back to normal state. The rupee lost 40 paise in the past one month and sensex is down. It will take minimum 6 months for the situation to come back to normal. remember we have only 4 printing press and can print only very limited amount of money per day. we cant print money overseas. people doesnt have money to spent and business are struggling. countries like america australia and uk took 10 years to move towards  digital transactions. It  will not happen in one night for god sake. for a country like india it will take 10 years mark my words. people have died standing lines and whole country is suffering. the worst Idea ever i still cant beleive he is feeling great about this. he cant even talk in the parliament about this.	1

3468	"What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoğan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoğan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under Erdoğan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.

Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoğan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil."	0

3528	"*Trump's first day at the Oval Office after being elected President.*

First briefing by the CIA, Pentagon, FBI:

Trump: We must destroy ISIS immediately. No delays.

CIA: We cannot do that, sir. We created them along with Turkey, Saudi, Qatar and others.

Trump: The Democrats created them.

CIA: We created ISIS, sir. You need them or else you would lose funding from the natural gas lobby.

Trump: Stop funding Pakistan. Let India deal with them.

CIA: We can't do that.

Trump: Why is that?

CIA: India will cut Balochistan out of Pak.

Trump: I don't care.

CIA: India will have peace in Kashmir. They will stop buying our weapons. They will become a superpower. We have to fund Pakistan to keep India busy in Kashmir.

Trump: But you have to destroy the Taliban.

CIA: Sir, we can't do that. We created the Taliban to keep Russia in check during the 80s. Now they are keeping Pakistan busy and away from their nukes.

Trump: We have to destroy terror sponsoring regimes in the Middle East. Let us start with the Saudis.

Pentagon: Sir, we can't do that. We created those regimes because we wanted their oil. We can't have democracy there, otherwise their people will get that oil - and we cannot let their people own it.

Trump: Then, let us invade Iran.

Pentagon: We cannot do that either, sir.

Trump: Why not?

CIA: We are talking to them, sir.

Trump: What? Why?

CIA: We want our Stealth Drones back. If we attack them, Russia will obliterate us as they did to our buddy ISIS in Syria. Besides we need Iran to keep Israel in check.

Trump: Then let us invade Iraq again.

CIA: Sir, our friends (ISIS) are already occupying 1/3rd of Iraq.

Trump: Why not the whole of Iraq?

CIA: We need the Shi'ite govt of Iraq to keep ISIS in check.

Trump: I am banning Muslims from entering US.

FBI: We can't do that.

Trump: Why not?

FBI: Then our own population will become fearless.

Trump: I am deporting all illegal immigrants to south of the border.

Border patrol: You can't do that, sir.

Trump: Why not?

Border patrol: If they're gone, who will build the wall?

Trump: I am banning H1B visas.

USCIS: You cannot do that.

Trump: Why?

Chief of Staff: If you do so, we'll have to outsource White House operations to Bangalore. Which is in India.

Trump (sweating profusely by now): What the hell should I do as President???

CIA: Enjoy the White House, sir! We will take care of the rest!

3533	"THE SIKH GENOCIDE OF 1984

THE VERDICT DELIVERED IN THE NARODA PATIYA CASE IN THE ANTI MUSLIM GUJARAT RIOTS OF 2002 IS A WELCOME ONE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE I984 SIKH GENOCIDE WHICH HAPPENED AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF THE INDIAN PRIME MINISTER INDIRA GANDHI BY HER 2 SIKH BODYGUARDS IN RETALIATION FOR OPERATION BLUESTAR, JUSTICE IS YET TO BE DELIVERED. Though Indira Gandhi has been rated by you among the greatest Indians, but I don't feel she has done anything Great to be on this list. We Sikhs don't hold her in high esteem. HOW CAN YOU CALL HER A GREAT INDIAN WHEN SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UNACCOUNTED DEATHS OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT SIKHS WHO ARE A MINORITY COMMUNITY? She only created Bhindranwale to counter the Akalis in Punjab & is responsible for the rise of Religious Extremism in the state AS PRIOR TO THAT, THERE WAS NO RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM IN PUNJAB. Even after her death, 20,000 Sikhs were murdered all over India (4,000 in Delhi alone) from 31st October till 4th November 1984 in a cold blooded Genocide led by the SECULAR CONRESS PARTY OF INDIA. Sikhs were burnt alive in front of their families, women were gang raped & their property was set on fire. The mobs were laughing as they were killing the Sikhs. The goons were led by local Congress MPS with Govt voter lists in their hands to aid them in finding Sikh houses & properties & were exhorting non Sikhs to kill as many Sikhs as possible. The local Congress MPs even gave the rioters money telling them that the person who will kill the maximum number of Sikhs will get the greatest amount apart from other incentives. From Oct 31 till Nov 3, blood curdling cries of “KHOON KA BADLA KHOON SE LENGE – WE WILL AVENGE BLOOD WITH BLOOD” were broadcast on Delhi Doordarshan & even the renowned actor of Bollywood, Amitabh Bacchan was instigating the people to kill the Sikhs. The Congress was in power at the Centre at the time of the Riots, & P.V.Narasimha Rao was the Home Minister, but he did nothing till Nov 2 despite knowing about the carnage & the Delhi Police just stood as mute spectators instead of protecting the Sikhs & let the bloody carnage to continue as directed by their political masters. Most of the Senior Police Officers deliberately went on leave from Nov 1 to 3 as directed by their political masters.The Army was deliberately not called & were only told to come on the evening of Nov 2, but still there was no one to guide them through the streets of Delhi. Then on Nov 3, after their quench for blood was satisfied, as if by remote control, everything stopped. It was nothing but a cold blooded genocide directed out by the senior Congress politicians against the Sikhs. Had prompt action been taken on the first day of rioting, this Genocide would have never taken place. IT IS A MATTER OF GREAT SHAME FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THAT STILL THE PERPETRATORS OF THE 1984 SIKH GENOCIDE HAVE NOT BEEN ARRESTED NOR ANY PROPER LEGAL CONVICTION TAKEN AGAINST EVEN A SINGLE PERSON UNLIKE THE MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS IN THE 2002 POST GODHRA RIOTS WHICH HAPPENED MUCH LATER DESPITE REPEATED PLEAS BY THE VICTIM’S FAMILIES.
The killers & murderers are roaming scot free & some are even ministers in the ruling Congress Govt. NEITHER ANY PROPER COMPENSATION BEEN PAID TO THE VICTIMS OF THE 84 RIOTS, NOR HAS ANY PROPER APOLOGY BEEN GIVEN OR ANY MEMORIAL CONSTRUCTED IN THEIR MEMORY BY THE GOVERNMENT. UNLESS THE PERPETRATORS OF THESE HEINOUS CRIMES ARE BROUGHT TO BOOK, I WON’T BE SURPRISED IF THIS CARNAGE IS AGAIN REPEATED. THE CONGRESS GOVT IS STILL IN DENIAL ABOUT THIS BLOODY CARNAGE AS MANY OF THEIR SENIOR MINISTERS ARE INVOLVED IN THIS GENOCIDE & APART FROM ISSUING HALF HEARTED APOLOGIES WHENEVER IT WAS CONVENIENT TO THEM, THEY HAVEN’T DONE ANYTHING AT ALL. THEY ARE HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT BY LIVING IN DENIAL, THEY CAN MAKE PEOPLE FORGET THIS TROUBLED PHASE OF HISTORY, BUT THEY ARE GROSSLY WRONG AS HISTORY NEVER FORGETS ITSELF. UNLESS THE GUILTY ARE NOT BROUGHT TO BOOK, IT WILL LEAD TO A VERY FRUSTRATED & ANGRY GENERATION PRONE TO DRUGS & VIOLENCE."	1

3588	"Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.

SADLY IN  OUR  COUNTRY  NOW  , THOSE  HAVING ENOUGH MONEY  AND  POLITICAL  SUPPORT  CAN  BRIBE  AND BUY  ANY  BODY  IN  OUR DEVIL'S OWN  COUNTRY 

 AND  THAT INCLUDES  PERHAPS    JUDGES  TOO  SINCE  THEY  ARE  PART OF  THE  COMMUNITY!  RIGHT???

THE  PROBLEM STARTS   WITH  THE  VICTIM  OF  THE  FRAUD  OR INJUSTICE  APPROACHING  THE  POLICE  STATION  IN   THE AREA  OF  HIS  RESIDENCE  OR  AREA  WHERE  FRAUD  OR  INJUSTICE HAS TAKEN PLACE!  

IF  THE  CONCERNED STATION SUB-INSPECTOR  OR CIRCLE INSPECTOR  ARE  INFLUENCED  OR BRIBED  BY MONEY  OR  GIFTS  OR BY  POLITICAL  PRESSURE, IT IS  CHILD'S PLAY  FOR THEM  TO  FILE  A  DISTORTED  AND  MIS-LEADING  ""FIR"" AND TO  DESTROY  THE  MAIN PIECES  OF EVIDENCE  RELEVANT  TO  THE  CASE  

AND  THIS IS  EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED  IN A CASE INVOLVING CHEATING  AND  FRAUD OF MANY  CRORES OF RUPEES  INCLUDING  GOLD  ORNAMENTS  COLLECTED  BY FRAUD  FROM MORE THAN  25   GULLIBLE  KERALITES  BY  ""MANAPPURAM  FINANCE  COMPANY""  USING  FAUDULENT  MONEY  AND  GOLD   DEPOSIT  SCHEMES   AND USING ONE OF THEIR  WOMAN EMPLOYEE! 

THE  ""FIR""  FILED  COMPLETELY  TRIVIALIZED THE  CASE  OF  CHEATING OD ABOUT TEN  CRORES  RS  BY THE  ABOVE  COMPANY EMPLOYEE  AS  A  PETTY  CHEATING CASE  AND  CLEVERLY  LEFT  OUT  THE  NAME  OF  THE  COMPANY  IN  THE FIRST INFORMATION  REPORT  ( FIR) BY  THE  POLICE  ATHORITIES , SURELY UNDER  MONETARY  PRESSURE  OR  OTHE RPRESSURE!  

THE  CHEATED  AND  FOOLED  AND  LOOTED  INVESTORS  APPROACHED  THE  KERALA HIGH  COURT  AND  THE  HIGH COURT  AFTER  SOME  MONTHS, JUDGED  THAT  THE  ""FIR"" WAS  DEFICIENT  AND FAULTY  AND  JUDGED  THE  DEEPER  INVOLVEMENT  OF  ""MANAPPURAM FINANCE  COMPANY' IN THIS  MATTER 

BUT  SADLY  THE  HIGH  COURT DID  NOT  PASS  THE  JUDGMENT  TO  DISMISS  AND PUNISH  THE  POLICE  AUTHORITIES  FOR  FILING  A  DISTORTED  AND  FAULTY  "" FIR""  

AND IF  THIS  WAS  DONE  IT  WOULD  HAVE SENT    A  STRONG SIGNAL TO  ALL POLICE  PERSONNEL  NOT TO  DISTORT  THE  FIR  AND  NOT TO  DESTROY  THE  EVIDENCES  

AND  TO  PRESENT THE  CASE IN  FULL DETAIL  WITHOUT  HIDING  ANY  IMPORTANT EVIDENCE  RELEVANT  TO THE CASE!   AND  SADLY  MAJORITY OF  CASES  ARE  LOST  WITHOUT  EVIDENCE  DUE  TO THE  SAD  FACT  THAT  ""  FIR""  IS  FAULTY  AND  THE  CONCERNED  PERSONS  FILING  THE  FAULTY  FIR  ARE  NOT  PUNISHED  SEVERELY

 AND  HENCE THE  CROOKS  AND  CRIMINALS  GET  AWAY  WITHOUT GETTING PUNISHED  AND  THE  VICTIMS OF THE  FRAUD  AND  INJUSTICE  SUFFER  ALL THEIR  LIFE  WITHOUT  GETTING JUSTICE  BESIDES  LOSING  ALL  THEIR  WEALTH  TOO!

IT IS  RELEVANT TO  ADD THAT THIS  CHEATING CASE OF MANY CRORES  HAPPENED  WHEN  MR SEN KUMAR  WAS  DGP  OF KERALA  AND   

  THOUGH THE  SERIOUSNESS OF THIS  CHEATING CASE  WAS  BROUGHT  TO HIS ATTENTION  IN TIME, HE  DID NOT MOVE  EVEN A  SMALL FINGER  AND  DID  NOT COME FORWARD  TO  HELP THE  VICTIMS IN TIME  TOO!"	1

4026	"Sub:- Like of 29/11 attacks can’t be stopped without solving Kashmir problem which can’t be solved without end-game in sight. 

-----In the entire history of mankind it will be difficult to find another example where a country like India [of six times than Pakistan especially India with better level of advance in science & technology as is evident from ‘Mangal-yan’ the Mars mission] cowardly & helplessly tolerates repeated humiliation by way of armed aggression on it. India is facing such shameful situation for the simple reason that like Pakistan (and Bangladesh) India too foolishly does not understand that the last word on India’s partition is yet to be written.  

One more matter agitates a person like me born before independence and that too in Kota region of my native State of Rajasthan. We were brought up in a culture where a ‘Sainik’ laying down his life in a war was considered getting ‘Moksha’ through ‘Veergati’ [and we were told the stories of Rani Padmini and other ladies of Chittorgarh becoming ‘Sati’ because their husbands got ‘Veergati’ in battle and Hada Rani (from Kota - Bundi given in marriage to Chittorgarh) cutting her head and sending it as a memento to her ‘madhosh’ husband in order to motivate him to fight the battle against enemy and Rana Pratap never submitting to Akabar rather preferred to live in jungles while incessantly fighting to recover the lost forts and mother-land]. 

This culture has still remained but when  nowadays I see the soldiers and their officers dying (not in war against Pakistan) but like ‘keede-makode’ (insects) and at the top of it are called ‘Shaheed’ (Martyrs), I get confused whether the culture in which we were brought up was right or the present culture ? (where as a Veteran Colonel said after 29/11 on a TV program that after training of merely 3 to 4 months Jihadi under the very nose of security forces at border etc come from Pakistan and kill the well and extensively trained & groomed Indian soldiers and their officers at Army camp / Corps headquarters)  

But in any case, it is high time GOI realizes that earlier Congress party and now BJP headed by PM Modi and all other political parties in India have been and are incapable of solving Kashmir problem due to their communal mindset. Therefore before it is too late GOI should spare a meager amount of $ 4,400 for the launch of ‘United India Party’ which alone can solve Kashmir and other problems being faced by India. 

It is hoped that the Friends-of-India will constrain GOI to see reason as explained at:-     

http://www.alwihdainfo.com/At-least-after-29-11-friends-should-advice-India-to-spend--4400-to-solve-Kashmir-problem_a45603.html 

[Especially given the fact that India should not waste this opportunity where some Kashmiri Muslims are showing courage and patriotism to start office (with flag and board / banner) of pro-India national political party in Srinagar and in other parts of the valley where the writ of government of J&K and India does not run and on the contrary Pakistan supported Separatists have been able to inflict almost five months of shutdown on the people of Kashmir]

4126	"Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake."	1

When Anna is silent on Lokpal and vocal against AK, it seems Anna is in pain and anguish of his own failure and speaking against AK only because he is known and easy  accessible to him!! 
I think, Anna comments when a paid media goes out to poke him to speak against AK when some thing like political fight occurs in Delhi between Aap and BJP. Anna should look the political fighting and corruption separately before commenting to media. He should speak about Lokpal only if corruption is the only purpose of his thought and movement...."	1

4215	"Top 10 tricks played by the media to control the masses: 

1. Project 'everything is fine' in default mode- even if they are not - thus lulling sheople into complacency. ( buffer routine 'news', sports, celebrity gossip, science, etc. ). This technique is used by shepherds rearing sheep for slaughter.

2. Emphasise individual identity (nationality, religion, state etc.), to ensure subconscious separation ( the divide and rule policy ). 

3. Contrive 'voice of the poor' / 'protest power' etc., though these do not exist. This deludes people to 'think' they are in control. 

4. Stage events ( 'astro turfing', 'shills', 'fake witnesses', 'crisis actors' etc. ), to either fabricate 'mass movement', create paranoia or extreme fear, or distract masses from real issues.

5. Use sports, celebrities and gossip etc., to divert from real issues ( and shape public opinion ).

6. Play key supporting role for big sponsored false flag events, hoaxes, etc. ( for wars, laws, create fear, distract, etc.) Many of your favourite news anchors and journalists are in fact establishment ( intelligence ) officers.

7. Portray government as victim of crime ( cheating, assault, etc. ), so that the sheople would not later protest draconian laws against themselves.

8. Manufacture extreme fear, through exaggerated claims of disease, enemy power, terrorism, etc., ( to support wars, desensitise or divide people, for example ) 

9. 'Media black out', ( non reporting leads to ignorance or dumbing down ), or reporting with malevolence, ( stereotyping or demonisation ) - the most common control technique. 

10. Lastly, and most secretive, the media is owned by a handful of corporations and suppresses other sources of information. Media forms  the 'matrix' - a web of illusions to deceive the masses, and along with 'politics' are both secretly owned by banking families. 

Next time your favourite news media 'breaks news', ask yourself: ""Is this true, or is this their latest shill / hoax / false flag operation""?"	1

4238	"Hindus with full support from their religious scriptures, especially 'MANUSMRITI' has inflicted horrific torture on their Womenfolk & untouchable Dalits, since ages ... To promote the child-rape, baby-girls used to be married off to aged Hindu males, even before puberty ... Polygamy was practiced by most of the Hindu males, especially Brahmins, like Tiwaris, Dubeys, Choubeys etc. ... With religion by their side, some of them used to marry more than 100 Hindu-women, even at the death-bed (infamous Antarjali Yatra) ... After the death of old husbands, the just-married baby-girls used to be made 'SATI' by throwing her on the pyre of her husband ... 
A bengali film named 'Antarjali Jatra', under the direction of famous director Goutam Ghose was released in 1987. This movie chronicles the evil practices prevalent in Kulin Brahminism like polygamy & ... 'SATI practice', wherein a recently widowed woman would be immolated on her husband's funeral pyre.

All sorts of restrictions used to be imposed on WIDOWS ... on 'food intake', 're-marriage of teenage widows', 'right to property', 'social status', 'recreations' et al, whereas no restriction on any kind used to be imposed on WIDOWERS !
Now-a-days, Hindus are seen mocking at the 'Burqa' used by Muslims ... But ask any Hindu, why the hell they keep their wives-mothers-grandma under the ""GHUNGHAT"" or compell their Women- folk to use vermilion (SINDOOR/BINDI), when the married hindu-men use none ... They would become speechless ! 

Let alone the commoner, even the Goddess Sita had to appear for a fire-test to prove his 'purity', she was abandoned by Hindu-God Ramchandra when she was pregnant & forced to live in the Hermitage of Valmiki. Finally, she had to commit suicide ... In the same way Lord Krishna never married to 'Radha' & abandoned her & never met her again, after leaving Mathura for Dwarka ! Though he had 16,100 junior wives, besides 8 Principal queens ! 

Do you have the guts to name a single Hindu whose Great grand-ma / Grand-ma was not raped by his G. grand-pa / grand-pa when she was just a kid & made her to produce children like a rabbit !!

Finally, let me admit that I'm a devout Hindu myself ! And I'm proud of my religion as it allows me apply my brain to judge between good & bad ... to criticize all the evil customs of Hinduism without fear, shun them, change my ""DHARMA"" to suit the modern age ... AND HERE EXACTLY THE ISLAM IS LAGGING BEHIND ... No change, no scientific proof, no logic, no modification of Religious beliefs to suit the modern time-place, no criticism of age-old evil customs, no difference of opinions are permitted / practiced in ISLAM ... ""INTOLERANCE"" to others is the buzzword in ISLAM !!"	1

To me India has killed its own army personnel to blame Pakistan and prove Turkish president advocacy wrong. We have seen it in past as well especially at the time when Indian army massacred a Sikh village of Kashmir and blamed Pakistan for it. All this was done to get sympathy from US president Bill Clinton who came to advocate talks on Kashmir...!"	0

Really? Why don't you read this.

The Hamoodur Rahman Commission set up by the Pakistani government following the war noted various atrocities committed by the Pakistani military, including widespread arson and killings in the countryside, killing of intellectuals and professionals, killing of Bengali military officers and soldiers on the pretence of mutiny, killing Bengali civilian officials, businessmen and industrialists, raping numerous Bengali women as a deliberate act of revenge, retaliation and torture, deliberate killing of members of the Bengali Hindu minority and the creation of mass graves.[200] The Hamoodur Rahman Commission wrote, ""indiscriminate killing and looting could only serve the cause of the enemies of Pakistan. In the harshness, we lost the support of the silent majority of the people of East Pakistan.... The Comilla Cantonment massacre (on 27th/28th of March, 1971) under the orders of CO 53 Field Regiment, Lt. Gen. Yakub Malik, in which 17 Bengali Officers and 915 men were just slain by a flick of one Officer's fingers should suffice as an example"".
Several former West Pakistani Army officers who served in Bangladesh during the 1971 war have admitted to large-scale atrocities by their forces."	1

4346	Hats off to you Sir. No father should ever go through as to what you are going through right now. Its difficult for people to understand that every parent wants the best for their children. No parent wants to be labelled as the father of a terrorist. My appeal to each and every citizen is that please dont criticize or hold this family responsible. Looking at what the young generation is today influenced by it is not the fault of the parents but these youngsters themselves as they believe in Jehad, Freedom from everything and they have this strong conviction that they are right and everyone else is wrong. They unfortunately dont have the patience to demonstrate against the system peacefully. Guns never solved any problems. Guns will lead you to your grave sooner or later.	1

We here of so many unknown names who have atleast competing with other nations. They come from remotest of Indian villages and not so near from the corners of a MCD's and PVR's. This is more embracing moment for the urban population than rural because ,parents leave them to their passion but urban student gets forcibly converted into an engineer and to an IT professional traveling in H1B. we say infrastructure and bla bla available in our cities but nothing truly came from the so called metros. This elucidates the very fact of the conservative parenting from the urban divide.  Another stakeholder here is the local municipalities,state government and the central government by enlarge to create feeding grounds for the budding athletes,to identify them to groom them to coach them  and to make them compete.  Capital infusion will not be a problem with independent body of governing cricket here alone has funds to buy Boeing. we parents should take oath to take our potential childrens to travel new contours which they have never been.	1

4554	Though the IITians and other talented people leave our country to get to do what they want, their base (family) is in India. Hence in spite of spending a part of income they earn, they save and remit it to India. Such remittances serve a great purpose of balancing the current account deficit of our country. Hence though they aren't contributing directly at the beginning of their careers, they benefit their families and indirectly our country. Reverse brain drain is a phenomenon that is widespread today. A lot of these talented people left our country because they could not find the right environment in our country to nurture their interest or talent. Nowadays a lot of them return back with distinctions that are recognised throughout the world and are contributing by helping to set up the atmosphere so that in the future, our people need not go abroad.	1

I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake."	1

Eating Beef (Cow Mata) allowed in Hinduism.
Rigveda (10/85/13) declares, “On the occasion of a girl’s marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered.” 
Rigveda (6/17/1) states that “Indra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo.” 
Manusmriti (Chapter 5 / Verse 30) says, “It is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals, for Brahma has created both the eaters and the eatables.”
Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21) that, “I eat beef because it is very soft and delicious.”
Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, “The cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of ‘Shraddha’ of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage.”
Vashistha Dharmasutra (11/34) writes, “If a Brahmin refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of ‘Shraddha’ or worship, he goes to hell.”"	0

4656	"Pigeral : If you have problems with Muslim Azan then you must have problem with Hindu Aarti too. Both cause noise pollution.

Agniveer : There is difference.

1. How many times have you woken up at 4:30 in morning because of noise from Hindu Aarti in temples? Zero.

How many times have you woken up at 4:30 in morning because of noise from Azan in mosques? 365 times in a year (if you live within 5 km radius of a mosque).

Zero vs 365 settles everything.

Even if Aarti loudspeaker in your locality starts at 4:30 in full volume, you can simply go to the priest and he will reduce it. Just try doing it with a Moulvi in a mosque and see if you come back in single piece.

Pigeral : Huh, and what about your Ganesh Yatra, Hanuman Yatra? Don't they make noise? Stop them.

Agniveer : How many times in a year do Ganesh Chaturthi and Hanuman Jayanti come?

Pigeral : At least 10 days.

Agniveer : And how many times does Azan happen on loudspeaker in a year?

Pigeral :

Agniveer : Why silent? Let me help you. 365*5 = 1825. And then in addition, there are rallies, bike stunts, processions etc on Prophet's B'Day, Eid and Muharram etc.

So it is 10 vs 1825+. Are 10 and 1825 same?

Pigeral : Wrong is wrong. There is no bigger or smaller wrong.

Agniveer : Ok then, your 34/36/38 waist size is also wrong. Come to shape before commenting on our concerns on Azan.

Pigeral : How can you compare my personal fitness issue with an issue of 20% minorities?

Agniveer : Same way as you compared 10 with 1825+.

Pigeral :

Agniveer : Why silent?

Pigeral : Look, you can't interfere in others' religion. India is multicultural society. Every religion has equal rights.

Agniveer : Equal rights? Do we have equal rights? A Muslim can marry 4 women at a time and divorce them at will. A Hindu is jailed for doing same. Where are equal rights? And where are equal rights for Muslim women? You just need equal rights of noise. And you don't care about plight of 10 crore Muslim women?

Look, equal rights come with equal responsibilities. You follow equal laws, you will get equal rights. You act as some special hero, your a$$ will be kicked.

And finally, there is another solid difference. There is strong correlation between density of Azan and terror. Find out the places on earth where

1. Azan is maximum (lets call it Place 1)
2. Aarti is maximum (lets call it Place 2)

Then find out how many world's top terrorists/terror organisations do Place 1 group and Place 2 group produce.

That is the ultimate litmus test on which noise is dangerous and which is harmless.

Pigeral :

Agniveer : Why silent?

Pigeral : Who are you man?

Agniveer : A proud Hindu. A proud idol worshipper. A proud Jihadi-hater. A proud Indian. Agniveer is the name.

4658	"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/ 

 Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake."	1

4802	"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/ 

 Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake."	1

4836	"Why India Should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
Indus Water Treaty Is Illegal
The case of the 1960 Indus waters treaty, it has been signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and “nowhere it is declared that the said agreement/treaty has been signed in the name of the President of India”, 
“According to the ministry of external affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India...,” 

“According to the impugned agreement 80% water goes to Pakistan which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India coupled with further financial and natural injuries to national interest.”

If We Indians Keep Quit Today Our Future Generations Will Blame Us And Never Going To Forgive Us

India Need Be Like China Fast And Furious And Must Have Ability To Say On Face.
China Claim South China Sea 
China Made And Develop 7 Artificial Man Made Islands On The South China Sea So Quickly 
Then Why Can't India Stop Water From Our Own States And Union Territories Of India
We Need To Build More Dam On Indus River And Must Have Iccha-Shakti To Say Only One Sentence To World Bank F*ck Off 
India Is Scraping Indus Waters Treaty

If China Can Do For Their Mother Land 
Then Why Not India (If India Cannot Do)
Then Their Is Some Serious Problem In Our Indian Government System With Our Political Partys And Also With Our Useless Politician.
Who Just Know To Bark But Cannot Take Action.

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

5125	"Some of Mira's comments may stem from the judgement that full time mothers face today. Feminism is surely about choice. Child rearing is often a group activity and it is up to all the people involved in rearing the child to decide what role each one of them will play. Sometimes, it's a group; grandma, grandpa, mom and dad; so each one of them is able to do other stuff while spending a part of the day with the child. Sometimes both parents divide the responsibility. Sometimes, one parent prioritizes work and the other one is a full time caregiver. Sometimes you hire dependable help. No configuration is wrong. Economic factors also play a role in the decision. What I find a bit jarring is that she almost seems to shame working mothers for bringing up their children like a ""puppy"". As long as all parties (including the mother) have a choice, then it's all good."	1

Indus Water Treaty Is Illegal
The case of the 1960 Indus waters treaty, it has been signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and “nowhere it is declared that the said agreement/treaty has been signed in the name of the President of India”, 
“According to the ministry of external affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India...,” 

“According to the impugned agreement 80% water goes to Pakistan which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India coupled with further financial and natural injuries to national interest.”

If We Indians Keep Quit Today Our Future Generations Will Blame Us And Never Going To Forgive Us

India Need Be Like China Fast And Furious And Must Have Ability To Say On Face.
China Claim South China Sea 
China Made And Develop 7 Artificial Man Made Islands On The South China Sea So Quickly 
Then Why Can't India Stop Water From Our Own States And Union Territories Of India
We Need To Build More Dam On Indus River And Must Have Iccha-Shakti To Say Only One Sentence To World Bank F*ck Off 
India Is Scraping Indus Waters Treaty

If China Can Do For Their Mother Land 
Then Why Not India (If India Cannot Do)
Then Their Is Some Serious Problem In Our Indian Government System With Our Political Partys And Also With Our Useless Politician.
Who Just Know To Bark But Cannot Take Action.

There will be in constant fear on hoarding even 2000 Rs notes. People have started moving to banking and started transacting thro digital payments and this helps expand tax base. People who transact thro banks will be eligible to loans. At present  poor borrow at 3-10% per month & they can move to banks for credit at 10% pa. 

With GST indirect tax regime will be reformed and Direct tax regime reforms like taking out the exemptions are in process. 

Tax rates for Registering lands should go down as NITI ayog is suggesting, so that everything can happen in white. Govt can use benami transaction act to prevent future frauds. Demonetisation is base for reforms.  Lata Venkatesh is highlighting only windfall gains of cash not deposited…..We need to look at long term health of the economy"	0

5176	"My life with family as an Er. Entrepreneur have been spoiled due to Dubious Actions by Vengeful Officials of corrupted  ISI, SBI, KFC, etc.
From 1982 to 1997, they have played with my life as an SSI unit proprietor. 
During 1990, I tried justice  from ISI and SBI through Kerala State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission  and in 1992,  an appeal filed with National CDRC, both Commissions having Judicial as well as Non Judicial Officers found some technical reasons to deny me Justice. I had no advocate to sue my plight. All members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and obligation towards the system, I became silent and continue efforts to revive and rehabilitation of my Sick SSI unit with full cooperation of Industries Department.
On 7.7.1995, I paid to KFC on One Time Settlement in full spirit of letter  of KFC dated 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupted Officials, the unit taken over by Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 was kept with custody of KFC.
I was at  Head Office of  KFC, Trivandrum  after my OTS payment, till a road accident at Palauan over Trivandrum on 6.3.97. 
I was under treatment from Medical College  Trivandrum, Kannur District Hospital, City Hospital Mangalore, etc and in least of 1997, I visited KFC  HO with the help Crutches, and realised that instead of blood, water is flowing through the Officials and the same day visit Kerala State CDRC and very next day filed a complaint against KFC. After three months, the Commission received reply from KFC with copy to me. On the basis of KFC's reply, the Commission started dictating Judgement and Dismissed my Complaint directing to Sue in Civil Court.
Next day I filed a Review Petition besides few other. The Hearing Day when I stand with help of Crutches and started to express my view, the Commission President threatened on huge cost to be Ordered against me. I managed to escape the so called Consumer Court with fear. 
But still I know that any one have common sense will award justice to me from National and State CDRC on both cases. 
After ,1977 to 2009, I was under acute mental depression.
I started writing to Central And State Governments and hence passed 5 pages G O, in 2010 direct KFC to settle issues at Board Level and to write to various Ministries of Government of India to enquire and compensated me due to Dubious Actions by ISI and SBI. 
But my efforts continue yet, the Corrupted Officials also continue to resist my efforts at my 67th age. 
What we understand from the synopsis of plight- 
Officials have good salary and support from all cadre of Government to save corrupted ones with the backing of so called Provision in court both Judicial and Quasi Judicial, like CDRCs, Human Rights Commissions, etc.

My plight covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc.. and are at my face book account.
Shall I await for an early justice from the Authorities concerned within my last days and which will light to effectively to formation of New safety measures to self employed personals and prevent such bad experiences suffering by me and family.

5179	"Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake."	1

5360	Modijee showed positive attitude to Pakistan with the gesture of going to Pakistan to express the message of peace.We as Indians have learnt to be patient to the maximum until things cross the limits and when it did you could see the answer given for kargil and through  surgical strike for terrorism.The summary is we showed peace as a message through several gestures but when Pakistan kept on nagging us with terrorism that's were we as a country together supported the surgical strike for which several leftists like her asked for proof and had criticised the move.Showing gestures of peace as a country together to aborher country and showing gestures of antinationalism within the country are two different aspects where anti nationalism even through a post or gesture is highly condemnable at any level.	1

The choice is there, all the customers Christians, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains Muslims etc. They go to these store & buy what they like, every one has the freedom to choose , to eat they like.

5555	"What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoğan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoğan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under Erdoğan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.

Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoğan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil. Indian fooled by Saffron gay gangsters government"	0

5659	Mutilating the dead bodies is a war crime under Geneva Conventions. Allegations of Pakistani forces mutilating the two Indian soldiers today are serious and should be investigated impartially. Indian soldiers in the past themselves have been involved in mutilating the dead bodies, not just of combatants but civilians too. In March 2000 at Pathribal, 5 civilians were killed in a stage managed encounter and their bodies burnt, to avoid recognition. The CBI investigation charged a present Indian army General as an accused but army scuttled the prosecution. All such war crimes should be investigated and the culpable punished, whether Pakistani army, Indian army or even militants.	1

Mr Jetly said during his budget speech that we are largely a tax compliant society and presented that only 3.7 crores are  filling ITRs in this poor country with 125 crore population .

The reply by CAs : 

Sir, 
We have 82 crore voters 

- 75% are agriculturists ,61.5 crores ( You exempted them directly but, they can also buy cars , bunglows etc as you quoted.. your political counterparts are also enjoying this) 

Balance..........
20.5 crores 

Less: 24% BPL class ( Below poverty line)

15 crore population ( which is non agriculturist and non BPL) .. 

Less : Senior Citizens, Non working wives, unemployed youths, below taxable income earners...political class..(say 75%) ... in a typical indian family only 1 earning member and 5/6 are dependent on him....

Balance (15-11.25)=3.75 crores is the earning class ... which can file ITRs and ... they are already filling it.... 

.... so almost no gap as Mr Jetly is stressing unnecessarily without knowing his country🤓😝😱

if Looser Jetly wants more people's to come into tax net ...then... instead foolishly resorting to only rampant raids, surveys...notices... scrutiny ..... demonetisations etc etc terrorism ... he should defy his negative bureaucrats and .......

1. Introduce simple Income Tax on Agricultural Income on large landlords ( Say 10 Acres plus ) - you can add 26% of Agriculturists as tax payers ( Politicians are also enjoying this )

2. Instead of introducing 5000/10000 penalties on late filers of IT return ...
Come out with positive approach and introduce incentives to IT return filers ( learn from Pakistan, IT assessee gets discount in purchase of Car )

3. Introduce Privilege card to  those paying taxes above certain limit.. privilege card to entitle assessee with benefits like Priority quota in railway tickets , Use of airport lounges, subsidised medical facilities, etc etc... *let Tax payers feel proud*

4. Introduce medica"	1

Though today the cow in Punjab is only milking cow as the bullock are gone from our villages, tractors have replaced them but still the farmers respect cow. So I will request my Hindu brothers not to use force, killings Muslims to force them to respect cow, change their taste not to eat beef but turn to other type of meat, chicken, fish,  vegetation food, win them over with your argument not force, violence has never won & will not.

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

Eating Beef (Cow Mata) allowed in Hinduism.
Rigveda (10/85/13) declares, “On the occasion of a girl’s marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered.” 
Rigveda (6/17/1) states that “Indra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo.” 
Manusmriti (Chapter 5 / Verse 30) says, “It is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals, for Brahma has created both the eaters and the eatables.”
Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21) that, “I eat beef because it is very soft and delicious.”
Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, “The cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of ‘Shraddha’ of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage.”
Vashistha Dharmasutra (11/34) writes, “If a Brahmin refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of ‘Shraddha’ or worship, he goes to hell.”"	0

6211	"Kevin Gaskin.  You're most welcome to search the Bill of Rights, the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence but you'll not find anything about ""separation of Church and State"" contained in any of them.

Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802 to answer a letter from them, asking why he would not proclaim national days of fasting and thanksgiving, as had been done by Washington and Adams before him. The letter contains the phrase ""wall of separation between church and state,"" which led to the erroneous ‘short-hand’ for the Establishment Clause (U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights, Amendment I, Article III) that we use today.    

“Why do I have a freedom of religion…?”  The answer lay in the Congressional papers as they pertain to our Constitution as we know it today.  The process of drafting the First Amendment made the intent of the Founders abundantly clear; for before they approved the final wording, the First Amendment went through nearly a dozen different iterations and extensive discussions. 

“We do not want in America what we had in Great Britain: we don’t want one denomination running the Nation.  We will not all be Catholics, or Anglicans, or any other single denomination.  We do want God’s principles, but we don’t want one denomination running the Nation.”

This intent was well understood, as evidence by court rulings after the First Amendment.  In 1799 the court declared, “By our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion; and all sects and denominations of Christians are placed on the same equal footing.” 

One must realize that our Founding Fathers were striving to attain “freedom of religion” due to the oppressive authority of the Roman Catholic Church.  It wasn’t only Britain but most of Europe that fell under the awesome authority of Roman Catholicism.  Our Founding Fathers set about to recognize the many denominations of Christianity.  Further, they intended to recognize each denomination equally, as opposed to granting power of control by any one denomination.  Herein lay the misinterpretation of the reckless ‘shorthand’ known as “separation of Church and State.”  

A more accurate statement is likely “separation of denominations of the Church and State.”  Such interpretation is wholly supported by the Congressional papers in reference to the statement, “We do not want in America what we had in Great Britain: we don’t want one denomination running the Nation.  We will not all be Catholics, or Anglicans, or any other single denomination.  We do want God’s principles, but we don’t want one denomination running the Nation.”

As for the statement, “Most of our founding fathers were agnostic,” that is simply not true.  It is a blanket statement proclaimed by those who oppose religion in general.  Yes, there were agnostics in those days but they were not nearly so prevalent as claimed.  Thomas Paine was an English-American political activist, philosopher, political theorist, and revolutionary.  Although he is considered one of our Founding Fathers, he was shunned for his known agnostic beliefs.

John Adams is another erroneously accused of being agnostic.  Yet, here is a quote from President Adams in reference to Thomas Paine; ""The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will.”  I believe you’ll agree his words regarding Mr. Paine are more than sufficient to dispel any claims of his agnostic beliefs."	0

6587	"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake"	1

Also, if any Government official/ servant/ officer is accused of molesting and outraging the modesty of a lady, then he should be suspended immediately and if found guilty be dismissed from Duty. I know the laws are there but the implementation of such laws are very weak. Also, I think the media should keep highlighting the politicians that have criminal cases of rape and molestation against them so that the parties are finally forced to take action on such dirty politicians and kick them out of the party	0

6781	"Nice write up. However, before concluding that no gains are in sight, let us keep our eyes open and look for the gains which are overlooked in this article.                                                                                                                                      1)This could still be a paradigm shift. Don't forget that currency has been growing rapidly in our economy. In the words of former RBi governer Subbu Rao ""going up by 15 percent year on year since financial year 2015/16, significantly faster than the trend rate of 10.7 percent over the previous three years.Even increase in e-transactions does not sufficiently explain this increase in demand for currency, suggesting that some other dynamic was at play. The Government’s surprise move was evidently in response to this uncharacteristic expansion of currency in circulation, clearly out of line with the pace of expansion of economic activity.""  This trend would definitely be arrested if the govt. is serious and continue its efforts sincerely. And the economy could see much lower cash in circulation.                                                                                                                                   2) temporary squeeze in cash is pushing many to move into electronic payments. Convenience and efficiency  will make them move away from cash permanently wherever possible.                                                                         3) With much less cash in circulation, black money locked up in land and gold would not be easily converted into cash. This could reduce the illegal activities too                                                                                                                        4) Lower land and apartment prices would benefit economy eventually                                                                                                       5)All the 12lakh crore reported to be put back into banking system has left a trail. Tax authorities can trace them and this could increase the cost of doing business via parallel economy."	0

Will it damage its reputation and put a question mark on its developmental agenda?
  But knowing Modi & Amit  Shah,their ability to think far ahead of the rest,I think they have a game plan with far reaching consequence which will pay them rich dividend in the electoral battles down the line.
  Suppose they ensure for the next 2 years a splendid  model of governance   with high growth and  peace  coupled with impartial administration they bury the ghost and tag of 'communal' neutralize and silence the critics once for ever !  If the epitome of  right wing  'monster ' can make this paradigm shift then they will succeed in wooing.the minorities into their fold,which hitherto they have  not been able to.

A Baloch Activist Asked Shahrukh Khan For Support On Issue of Pak Atrcoties!! What SRK Did Next Will Make You hate Him Even More

A few hours ago, prominent Indian superstar Shah Rukh Khan displayed his tolerance widely on Twitter. He blocked a prominent Baluchistan leader Dr. Mahmud Baloch from following him on Twitter. The reason was simple – he had directed a few tweets towards Shah Rukh Khan asking his support to the blazing Baloch issue in Pakistan.

However, instead of helping or simply ignoring him, SRK – as he is famously known as – chose to put a full stop to him on his virtual media.

May I suggest you to Please read this report ,
If by ""appeasement"" you mean appeasement to mulism's.
Who are the most backward section in this country.Muslim's.
Reason's you ask? Communal prejudice, Ghettoisation ,Repeated Persecution.etc 
Just for your information Muslim's are even more backward than Dalits,SC's,ST's even Non-Hindu SC/ST(Tribal's).In fact the backward,poorest and ghettoised community in India are Muslim's.
When issues of these communities are bought in parliament no one objects.Ex Jat's,Patel,Tamil,SC's,Dalit,zoroastrian,Sikh , but if you talk about the conditions of Indian citizens who happen to be Muslim then its appeasement who constitute 14.2% of India's population."	1

Attacks on Uri  and Pathankot are the biggest failure of India, which is really a great concern and observed that after those two incidents have made other country very much enthusiastic over Kashmir issue. Naturally from strategic point of view India has to reassess the internal security aspect before entering to all out conflict . It is also observed, that ex generals have concede the intelligence failure in respect of Uri and Pathankot incidents . It is also to be asserted that , how far this type of failure is rooted?

The very next days after delivery of the car, I noticed some cloudy parts and bubbles on the driver and co-driver door of the car. then I spoke to the car dealership about the problem they notice the problem and send my car to their Maruti Suzuki Authorised service station on 02-01-2017 for fixing the problem.

After 15 days, the same problem was reoccurred. When I took my car to the Dealer (One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow – 226005) they again sent it to service station for rectification of the problems and delivered the car to me after two days.

The same problem has again been noticed on 13-02-2017. After just 20 days  again i.e. 24-02-17 the same problem has been noticed on the entire body of the car.

When I visit again the authorised service station of the dealership they refused to resolve the problem and misbehaved with me.

Today i.e. On 23.03.2017 My car is still under repair with Oneup Moters Arambagh from last 20 days.

I brought the car for use my old parents and not to send it repeatedly to the service station for repairs or fixing problems. My father is suffering from heart ❤ problems. As you know it is very difficult to senior citizens or to repeatedly visit the service station."	0

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoğan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoğan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under Erdoğan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.

Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoğan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil. Indian fooled by Saffron gay gangsters government...."	1

Nor should ye treat them with harshness, that ye may Take away part of the dower ye have given them,-except where they have been guilty of open lewdness; on the contrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity.

7571	“Hi 🙂 My name is Gurmehar Kaur. I am from Jalandhar, India. This is my dad Capt. Mandeep Singh. He was killed in the 1999 Kargil War. I was 2 years old when he died. I have very few memories of him. I have more memories of how it feels NOT to have a father. I also remember how much I used to hate Pakistan & Pakistanis because they killed my Dad. I used to hate Muslims too because I thought all Muslims are Pakistanis. When I was 6 years old, I tried to stab a lady in a burkha. Because for some strange reason, I thought she was responsible for my father’s death. My mother held me back and made me understand that Pakistan did not kill my dad, war killed him. It took me a while to know but today I do. I have learnt to let go of my hate. It was not easy but its not difficult. If I can do it, so can you. Today, I am a soldier too, just like my dad. I fight for peace between India and Pakistan. Because if there was no war between us, my father would still be here. I am making this video because I want the Governments of both countries to stop pretending and solve the problem. If France & Germany can become friends after 2 World Wars, if Japan & USA can put their past behind and work towards progress, then why can’t we?? Majority of regular Indians and Pakistanis want peace, not war. I am questioning the calibre of leadership of both nations. We cannot dream of becoming a first world country with third world leadership. Please pull your socks up. Talk to each other and get the job done.Enough state sponsored terrorism. Enough state-sponsored spies. Enough state-sponsored hatred. Enough people have died on both sides of the border. Enough is Enough. I wish to live in a world where there are no Gurmehar Kaurs who miss their Dad. I am not alone, there are many like me. #ProfileForPeace”.	1

7744	Dear Indian Express, I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.	1

7764	This is really the vote bank politics.   That's why young talented youth frustrated and opted for brain drain.  Also reflect its insecurity in facing the National party to resort such policies.  I don't know whether  there would be any realisation among the rulers that there also exists very  poor young talented youth starved for want of support from the  Government.  At least the reputed corporates/ NGOs should come to their rescue, since they were no bodies' babies.  The only solution is to teach a befitting reply for such parties by the matured educated and middle class people by invariably participating  in the Elections to change their mindset.	1

In our opinion we are on a brink of a global collapse there will be a cyclical recession in the time period of 2016-2018.

Global events that will exacerbate the recession:

- IMF's Foreign Reserve basket adds Chinese Yuan to its Forex basket reducing Euro's contribution to this basket by a considerable 7%+
- Euro will considerable depreciate 
- BREXIT - British Voters will actually vote for Britain to leave the EU
- US Elections and it's uncertainty.
- Crude Oil Glut
- China Debt-to-Equity conversion 
- Shemitah year of 2016

A Major global sell off should have happened on 2 October 2016 but as that is a Sunday on 3 October 2016, which is a Monday we will witness a global sell off and Global markets will correct in excess of 8%+ 

Targets in the range on 2016-2018
(All prices are in Rupees

Sensex: 18000-19000
Nifty: 6200-6400
Bank Nifty:8500-9000
ICICI bank: 110-120
SBI: 95-105

Google ""Shemitah Year 2016"" we are headed for the biggest blobal recession yet.
You have the opportunities to either become rich or become poor. 

Sit on cash don't buy anything right now.
Until, we reach the above Targets, you should sit on cash.

Welcome to Shemitah Year 2016.
Either you become rich or you become extremely poor the choice is yours the market has already dropped so much from 2014 that all gains have been wiped out and now we are in negative."	0

7920	"I think problem is not loudspeaker, but 'loudspeakers'. Even when one will suffice in an area, due to many mosques near to each other, they all start Azan. Second thing is Nowadays the problem is that, not everyone sings azan, as it should be. So it sounds very irritating. Most of the Indian maulanas don't know how to sing a perfect azan. Otherwise it sounds very soothing. Like this: 👇

7934	"What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoğan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoğan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under Erdoğan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.

Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoğan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil."	1

I respect this man for his bravery and this would be a lesson for those brain less people who join ISIS without knowing what Islam says about violence. Quran says , Killing one Innocent is as though as you killed the whole humanity and ISIS kill number of innocent people everyday and this proves they are not real Muslims. 
Second , I have heard from many non muslims saying Muslims are supposed to kill Non muslims where ever they find them though this is a mis understanding which I want to clear here; A verse in Quran was revealed during a war at the time of Prophet Mohammad in which the Muslims were ordered to kill the enemies but do not make any harm to children's and women who could possibly be there for some reason ' It is also mentioned at several places not to initiate a war before they start harming you Plus this verse was revealed only for that particular period of time . There is no verse in Quran which restricts a Muslim to be friend of non muslims or kill any person who is not a muslim. These are all rumors and mis understanding which makes some people sick and they start playing hatred games.

This shows that Iran and Pakistan are the source of terrorism. The United States exposed Pakistan and Iran to terrorist sources

8043	"The big myth on tax payers in India Data from a Chartered Accountants group.......
Mr Jetly said during his budget speech that we are largely a tax compliant society and presented that only 3.7 crores are  filling ITRs in this poor country with 125 crore population .

The reply by CAs : 

Sir, 
We have 82 crore voters 

- 75% are agriculturists ,61.5 crores ( You exempted them directly but, they can also buy cars , bunglows etc as you quoted.. your political counterparts are also enjoying this) 

Balance..........
20.5 crores 

Less: 24% BPL class ( Below poverty line)

15 crore population ( which is non agriculturist and non BPL) .. 

Less : Senior Citizens, Non working wives, unemployed youths, below taxable income earners...political class..(say 75%) ... in a typical indian family only 1 earning member and 5/6 are dependent on him....

Balance (15-11.25)=3.75 crores is the earning class ... which can file ITRs and ... they are already filling it.... 

.... so almost no gap as Mr Jetly is stressing unnecessarily without knowing his country🤓😝😱

if Looser Jetly wants more people's to come into tax net ...then... instead foolishly resorting to only rampant raids, surveys...notices... scrutiny ..... demonetisations etc etc terrorism ... he should defy his negative bureaucrats and .......

1. Introduce simple Income Tax on Agricultural Income on large landlords ( Say 10 Acres plus ) - you can add 26% of Agriculturists as tax payers ( Politicians are also enjoying this )

2. Instead of introducing 5000/10000 penalties on late filers of IT return ...
Come out with positive approach and introduce incentives to IT return filers ( learn from Pakistan, IT assessee gets discount in purchase of Car )

3. Introduce Privilege card to  those paying taxes above certain limit.. privilege card to entitle assessee with benefits like Priority quota in railway tickets , Use of airport lounges, subsidised medical facilities, etc etc... *let Tax payers feel proud*

4. Introduce medical insurance / life insurance on basis of average ITR filled... like coverage upto twice of Gross Income in ITR filled for mediclaim and ten times risk cover in case of life insurance 

5. Introduce Pension after 65 yrs of age on the basis of tax paid by tax payer during his working life..

Let honest taxpayers get certain direct benefits.... 

As on today, 3.3% of Indian population is filling ITRs as compared to 8% of China...adding large agriculturists to Income Tax may shoot the figure to more than 10% .... it may help you to cool your tax terrorism mindset and a tax compliant nation ...😊

8288	"Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake. http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/"	1
8289	You can do kadi ninda, :D or arnab can bark on TV, LOL!!!	1
8290	"I do not understand what you mean by India doesn't have Sharia Law. There can't be any restrictions on Appeal or advise. The leaflet does not name Nahid or any person it just says music is prohibited in Islam which is true
We are democratic country and follow democratic laws.
Every single time the paid and corrupt Indian Media blames Islam all narrow minded people take up arms and brand Islam as Evil.

That is allowed as free speech by Congress and Left who went to defend those in the University.
And now when a woman Minister reads that out as to what was happening in the University from the University authenticated documents, because evidence was asked, she was not being allowed to speak and interrupted with yelling and shouting and now they demand an apology from her, wait and take a deep breath, for blasphemy!
This, my friends, is the hypocrisy of Congress and Left who support free speech, and this my friends, is the hypocrisy of the pseudo-liberals and pseudo-feminists in this country, who would allow a real abuse of Mother and Mother land in a University in the name of free speech, but will not defend a woman who happens to be a Minister of a party that does not follow their ideology.
Such tolerance, much hypocrisy!"	1

In our opinion we are on a brink of a global collapse there will be a cyclical recession in the time period of 2016-2018.

Global events that will exacerbate the recession:

- IMF's Foreign Reserve basket adds Chinese Yuan to its Forex basket reducing Euro's contribution to this basket by a considerable 7%+
- Euro will considerable depreciate 
- BREXIT - British Voters will actually vote for Britain to leave the EU
- US Elections and it's uncertainty.
- Crude Oil Glut
- China Debt-to-Equity conversion 
- Shemitah year of 2016

A Major global sell off should have happened on 2 October 2016 but as that is a Sunday on 3 October 2016, which is a Monday we will witness a global sell off and Global markets will correct in excess of 8%+ 

Targets in the range on 2016-2018
(All prices are in Rupees

Sensex: 18000-19000
Nifty: 6200-6400
Bank Nifty:8500-9000
ICICI bank: 110-120
SBI: 95-105

Google ""Shemitah Year 2016"" we are headed for the biggest blobal recession yet.
You have the opportunities to either become rich or become poor. 

Sit on cash don't buy anything right now.
Until, we reach the above Targets, you should sit on cash.

Welcome to Shemitah Year 2016.
Either you become rich or you become extremely poor the choice is yours the market has already dropped so much from 2014 that all gains have been wiped out and now we are in negative."	0

Thank you for the support.

Kindly note our latest event with the FIA in Washington DC.

With trust,
Dr. A Monica Dorhoi
Chair of World Bank IMF Staff Meditation Club
in Washington DC

[Updated] The Meditation Club meets with Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA)Foundation on Monday, January 11, 2016

Just updated … Thank you for inviting us, Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA)Foundation on Monday, January 11, 2016

Dr. Dorhoi attended on Monday, January 11, 2016 the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) Foundation reception at Marriott Marquis in Washington DC. She has previously worked for over 7 years in financing road rehabilitation worldwide. Dr. Dorhoi also works on both financing and managing risk in Formula 1 racing as part of the different financing requirements.

Thank you to Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) Foundation for preparing and publicizing the progress made in the implementation of the goals set by the “United Nations Road safety in 2015”. The report was prepared by the World Health Organization.

At the event the book “Goals for change, partners for action” the Annual report of 2015 of the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA)Foundation was also featured.

The report enthusiastically embraces the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. To be more exact, the energy goals for development translated into a Global Fuel Economy Initiative in which the foundation is helping governments to develop global and regional programs, to find evidence of effectiveness at national and city level, and to bring in donors to support the national policies and initiatives.

In United States about 40% of the traffic related deaths were reduced in the last few years. The 2020 United Nations Millennium Goals in relation to road safety are to reduce the deaths due to traffic by 50 %compared to today’s number.

For Dr. Dorhoi the connection with the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) Foundation is blessed by her long time dedication to the causes of Ayrton Senna. The Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) is the organizer of the Formula 1 racing championships and Ms. Dorhoi, an American living in Washington DC in last 15 years has been a huge supporter for over 2 decades. Dr. Dorhoi is one of the greatest fans of the much beloved Formula 1 Racing Driver Ayrton Senna deceased in 1994 in San Marino. “The tragedy truly marked me in an undeniable way.”

Dr. Dorhoi is also grateful to Alan Prost of France and Williams Renault for the sportsmanship after the loss of the driver Ayrton Senna.

[Additional information: Updated press release were disclosed at the event venue.]

8893	"Respected Mr. Law MINISTER Sir,
Kindly make it convenient to be initiated redressal of grievances pending yet.
My life with family as an Er. Entrepreneur have been spoiled due to Dubious Actions by Vengeful Officials of corrupted  ISI, SBI, KFC, etc.
From 1982 to 1997, they have played with my life as an SSI unit proprietor. 
During 1990, I tried justice  from ISI and SBI through Kerala State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission  and in 1992,  an appeal filed with National CDRC, both Commissions having Judicial as well as Non Judicial Officers found some technical reasons to deny me Justice. I had no advocate to sue my plight. All members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and obligation towards the system, I became silent and continue efforts to revive and rehabilitation of my Sick SSI unit with full cooperation of Industries Department.
On 7.7.1995, I paid to KFC on One Time Settlement in full spirit of letter  of KFC dated 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupted Officials, the unit taken over by Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 was kept with custody of KFC.
I was at  Head Office of  KFC, Trivandrum  after my OTS payment, till a road accident at Palauan over Trivandrum on 6.3.97. 
I was under treatment from Medical College  Trivandrum, Kannur District Hospital, City Hospital Mangalore, etc and in least of 1997, I visited KFC  HO with the help Crutches, and realised that instead of blood, water is flowing through the Officials and the same day visit Kerala State CDRC and very next day filed a complaint against KFC. After three months, the Commission received reply from KFC with copy to me. On the basis of KFC's reply, the Commission started dictating Judgement and Dismissed my Complaint directing to Sue in Civil Court.
Next day I filed a Review Petition besides few other. The Hearing Day when I stand with help of Crutches and started to express my view, the Commission President threatened on huge cost to be Ordered against me. I managed to escape the so called Consumer Court with fear. 
But still I know that any one have common sense will award justice to me from National and State CDRC on both cases. 
After ,1977 to 2009, I was under acute mental depression.
I started writing to Central And State Governments and hence passed 5 pages G O, in 2010 direct KFC to settle issues at Board Level and to write to various Ministries of Government of India to enquire and compensated me due to Dubious Actions by ISI and SBI. 
But my efforts continue yet, the Corrupted Officials also continue to resist my efforts at my 67th age. 
What we understand from the synopsis of plight- 
Officials have good salary and support from all cadre of Government to save corrupted ones with the backing of so called Provision in court both Judicial and Quasi Judicial, like CDRCs, Human Rights Commissions, etc.

My plight covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc.. and are at my face book account.
Shall I await for an early justice from the Authorities concerned within my last days and which will light to effectively to formation of New safety measures to self employed personals and prevent such bad experiences suffering by me and family.

9173	"When we drive abroad in other countries, traffic fines are huge due to which people take driving as a responsible & careful affair. Drunk driving is 6 months straight jail in some countries.

In India, we shift lanes without indicating, drive drunk, stand after the stop line at red signal and jump them without thinking twice of the serious implications. Non-existence of emergency lanes on roads. People not giving space to Ambulance & other emergency vehicles. I also lost my mother while in ambulance just because few people had more important places to reach and blocked our way. Believe me your perspective of driving would change completely when you are in a situation like that one.

So I fully support government's decision to make the fines at par with the global norms and hope that all the traffic violators get what they actually deserve."	1

I smell some foul into it. India has a huge presence of army at the border. How come Pakistani army did surgical strike n Indian army had no knowledge of it. How Pakistani went back safely. 

It all happened at a time when Turkish President was advocating talks on Kashmir.... 

To me India has killed its own army personnel to blame Pakistan and prove Turkish president advocacy wrong. We have seen it in past as well especially at the time when Indian army massacred a Sikh village of Kashmir and blamed Pakistan for it. All this was done to get sympathy from US president Bill Clinton who came to advocate talks on Kashmir...!"	0

In short, Our taxes are used to contribute brightest of the brains to USA.
PS: Some may argue by quoting examples of Narayanamurthy, Kejriwal, etc. But understand that those are just a handful of them. The majority of them do not contribute anything for the country that provided them education in IITs.
